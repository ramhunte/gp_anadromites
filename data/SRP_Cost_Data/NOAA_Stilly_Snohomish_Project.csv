00-1202,Ricci Island/Lake Beecher Acquisition,"Snohomish County acquired fee simple title to the Lake Beecher Property, an approximately 75-acre parcel formerly owned by Rinker Materials West LLC. Acquisition and protection of this property substantially contributes to salmon recovery efforts along the mainstem Snohomish River by protecting over one mile of high-quality riparian habitat, side-channel sloughs, and Lake Beecher, a historic oxbow over one mile long. Future restoration efforts will establish increased hydrologic connectivity with Lake Beecher and the mainstem, providing additional off-channel rearing habitat. This property also expands public ownership adjacent to the 350-acre Bob Heirman Wildlife Refuge, also owned by Snohomish County, and enhances the ability to develop joint restoration and management plans for the two areas.

00-1206,Stillaguamish Old Channel Habitat Rest.,"The Stillaguamish Flood Control District used this funding to restore salmon habitat in the old channel of the Stillaguamish River. The completed project is comprised of two elements: 1) a unique, instream flow-enhancement structure (Hanson Gate) that increases freshwater flow in the Stillaguamish Old Channel, operated and maintained by the Flood Control District, and 2) revegetation on just under seven miles of Old Channel streambank, averaging 50 feet wide, with a minimum of 35 feet. This included noxious weed control and fencing where livestock are present. More than 15,500 native trees and shrubs were planted.  These restoration actions combine to improve dry-season water quality in the Old Channel to class A levels and to restore healthy habitat for fish and wildlife. Water quality data from the Stillaguamish Tribe Natural Resource Department confirmed that the projected improvement in dissolved oxygen levels was achieved.

00-1209,Twin River Quarry Acquisition,"Snohomish County used this funding to acquire the Twin Rivers Quarry property located at the confluence of the Snoqualmie and Skykomish rivers.  The 157 acre property contains 5 acres of diked agricultural land within the floodplain along the right bank of the Snohomish River, downstream of the SR 522 bridge.  The floodplain and its associated riparian area (mature, conifer-dominated forest) encompass 66 acres.  The remaining 91 upland acres feature two small creeks which descend a forested hillslope, merge, and flow through the bed of an historic side-channel that connected to the Snohomish River prior to diking.  The site's 3,700 linear feet of riverfront has been armored with riprap along its entire length.    The site would provide an excellent restoration opportunity to remove bank armour, reconnect the side channel, and replant native riparian vegetation.  The objective would be to restore rearing habitat for juvenile salmon in off-channel areas and along the main-stem edge.  Dike removal would also restore habitat-forming processes by allowing the river to migrate laterally through its floodplain.",3/17/2000,11/21/2002,Acquisition,Closed Completed,Salmon State Projects,Snohomish County Parks Dept," $ 2,339,360.19 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=00-1209,Snohomish Basin LE
00-1764,Snoqualmie River Mainstem Reach,King County Department of Natural Resources purchased a 14.26 -acre parcel along the Snoqualmie River.  The target parcel contains roughly 1000 feet of riverfront along the Snoqualmie. The reach is one of the few stretches of the lower Snoqualmie with a forested riparian corridor that extends more than a few feet from the ordinary high water mark. The forested riparian corridor is well over 300 feet (the red polygon on the enclosed aerial photo demarcates the 300-foot buffer from the approximate river centerline). The parcel also contains portions of a side channel feature that the county wants to protect as a winter rearing area for Chinook salmon.  The location of the side channel is critical in that it is just downstream of two of the four primary spawning areas for the Snohomish Fall Chinook stock.  Snohomish Fall Chinook may be especially dependent on freshwater rearing habitat. Data collected from returning adults suggest that a high proportion of the stock spends an entire year in freshwater habitat before moving to salt water.,2/7/2001,6/8/2004,Acquisition,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,King County DNR & Parks," $ 98,114.43 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=00-1764,Snohomish Basin LE
00-1766,Tolt Floodplain Reconnection Site Analys,"The City of Seattle used this funding to complete a site analysis to determine the feasibility of relocating and restructuring the levee system to increase and improve fish habitat on the lower Tolt River. Project area is the lowest mile of the Tolt River, to the confluence with the Snoqualmie River used by Snohomish fall Chinook, coho, chum and steelhead. Seattle City Light 1) developed a conceptual design for levee setback and removal that will allow the channel to meander unconstrained, without decreasing the level of flood protection provided by the existing levees; and 2) quantified increases and improvements in Chinook spawning and rearing habitat that would occur as a result of the project.  The lower Tolt River is one of the most constrained sections of river in the Snoqualmie Watershed.  The Tolt Floodplain Reconnection Project would increase spawning habitat for Chinook salmon, increase protection of Chinook salmon redds by reducing scour, and increase rearing habitat for all native salmon and trout using the lower Tolt River.  The future restoration project involves setting back or removing levees that currently constrain the channel, reconnecting the river to the main channel, historic side channels and a wetland at the mouth of the river.  This reconnection is expected to enhance abundance, diversity and distribution of Chinook, coho, chum and steelhead within their historical range.",1/26/2001,5/4/2004,Planning,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,Seattle City of," $ 190,000.00 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=00-1766,Snohomish Basin LE
00-1768,Koonz Creek Towne Barrier Removal,"Washington Department of Fish and WIldlife (WDFW) used this funding to replace a failing culvert and its associated fill with a bridge at a private driveway crossing to restore salmonid fish access to the entire upper watershed of Koonz Creek.  Design work was completed in December 2000.  WDFW determined the bridge option was the most cost-effective solution to meet statute fish passage criteria in this steep gradient reach where the stream is deeply incised with very steep side slopes.  The project is located off 99th Avenue NE from the Grandview Road near Bryant north of Arlington.  The project was sequenced with the bridge being installed first adjacent to the existing crossing followed by removal of the culvert and fill and restoration of the channel and slopes.  This method provided continuous driveway access for residents including emergency vehicles during the expected two month construction period.  Coho salmon, steelhead, sea-run cutthroat trout, resident trout, and bull trout are the beneficiary species.  Removal of the blockage recovered a measured linear 4.4 miles (7,086 meters) of habitat with a Priority Index of 25.95.  Partners included Snohomish County, Stillaguamish Tribe, and affected landowners.",1/26/2001,6/3/2003,Restoration,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,Fish & Wildlife Dept of," $ 298,100.00 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=00-1768,Stillaguamish River LE
00-1770,Tolt River Aquisition,"The King County Department of Natural Resources purchased 10 properties capturing 37.6 acres on the Tolt River. The acquired parcels lie in significant channel migration areas along the lower Tolt River, approximately from RM 2.5 - 3.5 and from RM 5.5 - 6.5.  Much of this area is a high quality, undeveloped riparian corridor. Log jams create pools and deflect flows into side channels. The number and extent of side-channel formations provide a high degree of habitat complexity, creating a full range of habitats for multiple species and multiple life stages of salmon and other species.  The objective of this acquisition is to prevent additional residential development in the stream corridor up to the Forest Production District boundary and to encourage the interplay of natural processes on the landscape. Acquired land is managed for habitat protection by the King County Parks System. King County Parks System has an excellent track record of managing habitat areas through its natural area protocol, which currently applies to more than 1,000 acres countywide.",2/7/2001,2/23/2005,Acquisition,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,King County DNR & Parks," $ 431,895.64 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=00-1770,Snohomish Basin LE
00-1773,Patterson Creek Reach 3A Acquisition,"King County Department of Natural Resources  purchased two parcels totaling 18.5 acres.  The target parcels host mature coniferous, forested wetlands along both banks of Patterson Creek.  The undeveloped riparian area extends well over 300  feet on either side of the stream.  Extensive beaver activity helps to maintain high quality rearing habitat for salmonids thought the year.   King County targeted these parcels for acquisition in 1995 as part of its Waterways 2000 program.  Waterways 2000 was a program that identified and protected hundred of acres of important aquatic habitat in King County.  The program received an Achievement Award from the national Association of Counties in 1996 as an innovative program worthy of replication by other local governments.    This acquisition was added to an existing 150 acre waterways 2000 site owned by the County and managed for habitat protection purposes. The objective of this acquisition was to insure protection of important stream associated wetland habitat.  Acquired land is managed for habitat protection by the King County Parks System.

00-1775,NF Stillaguamish Road Decommissioning,"The Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians partnered with the US Forest Service and Washington Department of Ecology to restore hillslope hydrologic processes altered by roads associated with the densely roaded South Branch and Crevice Creek subwatersheds in the upper North Fork Stillaguamish drainage. This project treated 13 miles of roads  to reduce road densities and the risk of road failure that could lead to catastrophic sedimentation into South Branch, Crevice Creek, and downstream into the North Fork Stillaguamish mainstem. This work entailed varying levels of treatment depending upon risk failure. The project also included removing culverts,adding drainage dips, hardening drainage dips, removing side-cast material, and recontouring slopes by pulling back fills on nine miles of decommissioned road and four miles of road that access areas expected to be enhanced for late-successional reserve habitat within 20 years.   Resident and anadromous fish which benefit from decreased sedimentation include Chinook, coho, pink, chum, steelhead/rainbow, sea-run/resident cutthroat, bull trout/Dolly Varden, and riverine sockeye.  Expected benefits include increased survivability of eggs and juveniles, as reduced sedimentation improves the quantity and quality of spawning and rearing habitat.  Benefits will be delayed but long-lasting as the roads revegetate and their influence on local hydrology lessens.",2/1/2001,10/26/2005,Restoration,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians," $ 129,849.89 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=00-1775,Stillaguamish River LE
00-1779,Westside Higgins Road Sediment Control,"Snohomish Conservation District partnered with the US Forest Service to provide controlled drainage along 5.4 mi. of Westside Higgins Rd 1820 to reduce risk of road failure, erosion and sediment production and to reduce effects on fish habitat and water quality in Higgins Creek, a major tributary to Deer Creek (an important tributary to the North Fork Stillaguamish River).  Bull trout, steelhead and coho utilize Higgins Creek, while Chinook, pink, chum, and sea run cutthroat trout utilize lower Deer Creek.  Higgins Creek has 4.5 miles of anadromous and resident fish habitat and has been identified as refugia for steelhead, coho and char in the Deer Creek basin (Collins et al., 1995).  The project applied various treatments, including adding and/or replacement of culverts, fill stabilization, installation of water bars and removal of road prism where needed for stability. The expected results include improved water quality and incremental reduction of the risk of landslides and sediment delivery. This will reduce the potential for erosion, scour, and sedimentation associated with the existing situation.  This action is expected to help reduce road-associated failures and other sedimentation that is occurring from water collection and concentration.  Better spawning, rearing and holding habitat conditions for salmon and other aquatic species will result.  Monitoring has been an ongoing part of this restoration effort.",3/1/2001,3/12/2003,Restoration,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,Snohomish Conservation Dist," $ 120,328.97 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=00-1779,Stillaguamish River LE
00-1780,Griffin Creek Mid-Zone Reach Acquisition," Salmon Recovery Funding was used to purchase 19 parcels covering 9 acres along Griffin Creek. The target parcels extend about one third of a mile along both banks of Griffin Creek.  The undeveloped riparian area extends more than 300 feet on the left bank of the stream and 100-300 feet on the right bank.  King County targeted these parcels for acquisition in 1995 as part of its Waterways 2000 program.  Waterways 2000 was a program that identified and protected hundreds of acres of important aquatic habitat in the County.  The program received an Achievement Award from the National Association of Counties in 1996 as an innovative program worthy of replication by other local governments.  This acquisition added to two existing Waterways 200 sites, encompassing 48 acres, owned by the county and managed for habitat protection purposes.

00-1783,Stillaguamish Landslide Hazard Zonation,"The Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians used this funding to develop a landslide hazard zonation map to be used as a decision making tool for future land management activities in the Stillaguamish watershed.  In 1997, a landslide inventory was conducted throughout the entire Stillaguamish basin (approximately 700 sq/mi).  Aerial photography from 1933-1991 was used to determine the number and size of all visible landslides.  1,080 landslides were cataloged (97%) from the North and South Forks.  Three quarters of the landslides are associated with forest land uses with 52% originating from clearcuts and 22% originating from roads.  Using the landslide inventory as a tool to determine why and where landslide activity occurred previously, a map was developed showing zones of high potential landslide risk for any future land use activity.  The map can be used by any agency conducting land use activities in the Stillaguamish basin.  Because over 70% of the land use within the basin is forestry, the primary users are Washington Department of Natural Resources, the US Forest Service, and private timber companies.  The ultimate goal of the project is to reduce the number of human-induced landslides impacting the watershed.",4/1/2001,10/26/2004,Planning,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians," $ 55,000.00 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=00-1783,Stillaguamish River LE
00-1838,Beckler Road Decommissioning,"This project decommissioned 9.43 miles of roads within the Beckler watershed, located 50 miles east of Everett within the Skykomish Basin.   Decommission treatments ranged from total removal of the road prism and complete recontouring of the hillside to approximately a natural slope, to some combination of removing culverts, removing unstable road fill, scarifying road beds, and waterbarring.  Work also included stormproofing 13.86 miles of road that are to be retained that currently deliver sediment to streams.  The objective was to largely restore and stabilize slopes that are currently contributing sediment to salmon bearing streams (including the  Beckler and Rapid Rivers) through surface erosion, and/or have high risks of contributing very large volumes of sediment through mass failures associated with the current road system.   The anticipated product should be a largely self-maintaining drainage system.  The work was spread over several square miles (see project map).  This project will benefit chinook salmon and bull trout, as well as several other salmon and trout species within the watershed.  Direct, near-term  benefits will occur through the reduction of ongoing chronic delivery of sediments into otherwise valuable chinook and bull trout habitat.  When combined with previous restoration work already completed by the USFS, this key project will  greatly help restore the Beckler watershed to the refugia its capable of being.

01-1193,Stillaguamish ELJ Monitoring,"Wild Fish Conservancy used this funding to conduct a five-year evaluation of the engineered log jams (ELJs) placed in the North Fork Stillaguamish. The monitoring was to confirm ELJ success or failure, document changes that occurred within the structures, and examine the long-term benefits to salmon, hydraulic interactions of the ELJs, and cost-effectiveness of the technology. Eight ELJs had been previously installed in the North Fork Stillaguamish to increase the quantity and quality of holding pool habitat for spawning summer Chinook in the reach between RM 21.3 and 22.8 (projects 97-1299 and 99-1367). Additional goals were to test ELJ technology and performance, enhance off-channel habitat, increase bank protection, and maintain wood in channel by creating areas of deposition. Project partners included the National Marine Fisheries Service, Snohomish County, US Army Corps of Engineers, Washington Department of Ecology, the Stillaguamish Tribe and the Tulalip Tribe.  This project monitored and assessed the original eight ELJs, completing over eight years of assessment on ELJ technology, and analyzing benefits to salmon with baseline and post-project monitoring.  This information can be used to assist and evaluate the success of additional ELJ installations being planned in other regions of the state. In collaboration with other agencies, the project produced standardized ELJ monitoring protocols. The monitoring on the North Fork Stillaguamish ELJs has and will continue to set standards for others to follow.

01-1290,Qwuloolt Estuary,"Using the grant funds provided a critical and strategically located 36 acre parcel central to initiation of an outstanding intertidal wetland project in the lower Snohomish River, was purchased.  This purchase helps to advance intertidal estuarine restoration of a 360+ acres site in the City of Marysville.  Restoration opens this area and the tributary creeks of Allen and Wood to access by threatened salmon species while recovering rare intertidal estuarine habitat into the system.  For chinook and other salmon species, this provides forage and resting areas, out-migration transition habitat, and rearing potential with spawning ground access to the creek drainage.

01-1292,Snoqualmie River Focus Area 7 Acquisitio,"The project protected high quality riparian habitat and created the opportunity to restore side-channel habitat within Focus Area 7, as identified in the WRIA 7 Near Term Action Agenda.  This project accomplishes the first element of projects 30 and 31 by acquiring habitat adjacent to the Snoqualmie River. With this grant, King County purchased a Conservation Easement on 25.8 acres along the Snoqualmie River. King County already owns 100 acres within Focus Area 7, protecting 33% of the riparian corridor in the reach.  Approximately half of the Snoqualmie portion of the Snohomish Fall Chinook run spawned in this reach in 2000.  The WDFW estimate of the chinook escapement fro the Snoqualmie Basin in 2000 was 1427 fish.  Protecting the riparian buffer will preserve woody debris delivery potential, maintain the capacity of the floodplain to trap nutrients, and preserve shading and edge complexity functions.  Creating the opportunity to restore side-channel habitat enables the restoration of in-stream habitat diversity to the reach.  Increased in-stream habitat diversity will increase the availability of scarce rearing and refuge habitats and restore spawning habitat for species such as chum and pink salmon.  Portions of the property are intensively utilized at present.  The proposal includes funding to begin restoration of these areas through planting native species, such as cottonweed, alder, red osier dogwood, Sitka spruce, and western red cedar.",5/1/2002,8/15/2006,Acquisition,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,King County DNR & Parks," $ 133,014.01 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=01-1292,Snohomish Basin LE
01-1298,Snohomish River Estuary Acquisition,"This project acquired 169.37 acres of diked land in the Snohomish River estuary for the purpose of restoring an estuarine tidal marsh.  The Snohomish Basin Salmonid Recovery Technical Committee has identified artifical barriers to access (e.g. dikes, tide-gates, pump-station) and the loss of wetlands within estuarine habitats as factors contributing to the decline of chinook salmon (1999).  Haas et al. (2001) estimated that the Snohomish estuary has lost approximately eight-five percent of its tidal marsh and at least 50 percent of its smolt production capacity for Chinook since the late 19th century.  The analysis suggests that as a result of this loss, the estuary may commonly constrain production of chinook salmon from the Snohomish River basin.  This site is one of the largest undeveloped properties in the Snohomish River estuary within private ownership.  Its acquisition would enable restoration of tidal marsh including the reconnection of one of the largest blind tidal slough channels in the estuary.  Blind tidal channels within estuarine marsh are used by salmonids for rearing and making the physiological transition from fresh to salt water.  Restoration of the site would also involve replanting riparian forest cover representative of the historic forest composition and increasing edge habitat complexity along the site's boundary with Union Slough.    On November 19, 2004 and as amended August 2, 2005, the RCO director approved a conversion allowing Snohomish County to grant an easement to Northwest Pipeline Corporation.  The conversion was mitigated with the acquisition of replacement property (the Rawlins property) valued in excess of the easement granted.  The replacement property is 0.26 acre adjacent to the Centennial Trail and will provided wooded buffer space for trail users.  The legal description for the replacement property is captured in that Deed of Right recorded in the Snohomish County Auditor's Office on December 13, 2005 under Auditor File No. 200512131249.    Amendment #3 to the grant project agreement reflects the easement conversion and the new replacement property as well as allows for a complementary covenant on behalf of the USFWS.

01-1304,Cherry Creek Floodplain Restoration Act,"Cherry Creek (CC) is the Snoqualmie River's lowest major tributary;  its location provides high recovery-benefit potential for listed Puget Sound chinook and other salmonids.  An agricultural drainage system (ADS) - 10,200-m of ditched channels, a 2,100-m levee, and a pumphouse-disconnects lower CC from its floodplain.  The ADS disassociates CC from important salmonid rearing-and spawning-habitat creation and maintenance processes.  The pumphouse impedes access to 12,000-m of spawning and rearing habitat, requires significant maintenance and is unscreened, causing direct mortality of juvenile chinook and other salmonids.  Wild Fish Conservatory collaborated with Drainage District #7 (DD#7), WDFW, NMFS, and affected landowners to develop ecologically sound solutions for restoring lower CC floodplain processes, while addressing the needs of DD#7.  The feasibility study reconstructed historical floodplain conditions;  collected and modeled elevation, groundwater, sediment-transport, hydrologic, and flooding data;  and assessed DD#7 needs.  Recent floodplain water-quality and fish-species composition and distribution data was be incorporated.  WFC presented the evaluated restoration-alternatives to projects collaborators, and sought consensus on selecting an appropriate alternative.  Upon final selection, WFC developed a construction design.

01-1307,North Meander Slough Reconnection,"Snohomish County used this funding to reconnect North Meander Slough to the Stillaguamish River, enhancing and restoring natural habitat forming processes for creating off-channel rearing for juvenile salmonids. It involved removal of a plug dike, excavation of deposited material, channel reconfiguration, wood placement, and riparian planting. North Meander Slough, located along the lower mainstem, is a horseshoe shaped channel approx. 4,600 feet in length.   Reconnecting the slough to the main channel restored over 3/4 mile of off-channel rearing and refuge habitat for juvenile salmonids and has a broad geographic effect because it created substantial off-channel rearing and refuge habitat, a multi-species limiting factor (WCC, 1999; Stilly TAG, 2000). Reconnecting the slough also provides foraging habitat for adult bull trout.   Reconnecting the North Meander created 12 acres of off-channel rearing. Using this area and regional density estimates, we estimate the project provided rearing for approximately 4,200 pre-smolt chinook/year. Pess, et.al. (1999) estimated that reconnecting North and South Meander, another slough just upstream, creates as much or more rearing habitat than the top twenty culvert replacement projects in the Stilly.",9/1/2002,3/16/2007,Restoration,Closed Completed,Salmon State Projects,Snohomish County of," $ 1,358,000.00 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=01-1307,Stillaguamish River LE
01-1308,Jorgenson Slough & Rock Creek Barriers,"The Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians used this funding to restore durable and efficient fish passage at four sites while accommodating natural channel hydraulics and conditions. The projects were a tidegate retrofit at Jorgensen Slough, a culvert retrofit on Church Creek, fishway removal rock weir placements in Stanwood, and a culvert retrofit at Rock Creek northeast of Arlington.   This project began as culvert replacements on two box culverts; one in Church Creek and one in Rock Creek. After further consideration it was decided to retrofit the box culverts with baffles, fishway steps and water control weirs. With the cost savings we were able to remove a blocking fishway downstream of the Woodland Road culvert and replace ancient cast iron tidegates with light weight plastic more fish friendly ones. Snohomish County Surface Water Management provided some design and engineering time as well as being the general contractors for the work  The Jorgensen Slough project restored 16,237 linear meters of habitat (virtually 100% of the stream) and the Rock Creek project restored 5,158 linear meters (about 75% of the stream). The proportion of spawning habitat (20-38%) to rearing habitat (51-81%) upstream of these culverts is excellent for good production through all life stages of the target species: bull trout, chum, coho, cutthroat, steelhead, and pink (Jorgensen Slough only). Projects were designed according to WDFW standards described in their Fish Passage Design at Road Culverts.  Recovery of this extensive high quality existing habitat now is important for the immediate multiple species benefit while longer-term upslope improvements and estuarine/delta habitat recovery measures are being implemented. Additionally, the relative stability of these watersheds with the abundance of rearing area will help to provide the needed conditions to buffer these populations from the damaging winter scour and summer low flow stranding seen elsewhere in the basin.

01-1338,Port Susan Bay Acq. & Restoration Assess,"This project permanently protected approximately 3,962 acres of estuarine wetlands and 160 acres of diked uplands in Port Susan Bay, Snohomish Co., WA.  The estuary provides spawning and rearing habitat for multiple salmonids including the federal and state threatened chinook salmon and candidate coho salmon.  A restoration technical feasibility assessment was completed.  The goal was to design, engineer, and commit to appropriate future restoration actions consistent with watershed planning efforts and in cooperation with public lands and private partners.  Loss of estuarine salt marsh and tidal channels has significantly reduced the quantity and quality of juvenile and adult salmonid habitat.  The property is the largest block of private tidal and estuarine wetland habitat in the Puget Sound.  It is actively threatened with residential, commercial and recreational development, and Spartina.  With so little coastal wetland habitat remaining, the proposed acquisition is essential for preserving biodiversity, aiding in species recovery and enhancing natural ecosystem processes.  The project addressed several recovery actions for the federally listed Chinook and other salmonids: 1) acquisition of sites with restoration potential 2) restoration of degraded estuarine habitat conditions preferred by juvenile chinook 3) potential restoration of sites where dike removal could enhance habitat forming processes and 4) studies that lead to development of priority future restoration projects.

01-1422,Robe Canyon Laird Preserve,"Cascade Land Conservancy (now Forterra) used this funding to help acquire the 82-acre Robe Canyon Laird Preserve, which protects critical spawning and rearing habitat for coho, Chinook, chum, pink, steelhead and bull trout on the South Fork Stillaguamish River. The WA Conservation Commission report listed Robe Valley as the number 5 priority out of 27 sub-basins and recommended protection of highly functioning habitat as the most cost effective approach. Protection addressed documented limiting factors such as preservation of 1/2 mile and at least 30 acres of intact riparian habitat, historic side channels and pools, an active beaver population, and a large gravel bar with large accumulation of large woody material. The quality and size of the riparian forest is significant and contributes to increased large woody material and pool area essential for spawning and refugia.  The property is contiguous to Robe Canyon Historic Park, encompassing 970 acres of forested land along Robe Gorge. In late 2000, the landowner contacted Cascade Land Conservancy concerning the imminent sale of the property. Acquisition of the property helps eliminate the threat of logging and development and expands the area currently protected within the Park.

01-1429,Stillaguamish Riparian Enhancement Crew,"Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians used this funding  to provide a supervised crew of offenders to prepare, implement, maintain, and monitor riparian restoration projects in the lower Stillaguamish River subbasins.  This project planted more than 25 miles of streambank and over 150 acres of wetland habitat .  These restoration efforts followed on inventory of the riparian condition of the entire watershed using a combination of aerial photography and field verification (Pollock, 1999).  Habitat biologists within the Stilly prioritized the sites and oversaw all the projects.    Riparian areas throughout the Stillaguamish watershed provide critical habitat for all species of anadromous salmon, steelhead, and bulltrout.  The Stillaguamish basin has several reaches that are listed on the State 303(d) list of temperature and dissolved oxygen.   The crew was trained in growing native plant materials and restoration techniques.  Control of invasive weeds, prior to planting and during the critical two years after planting, was also important to survival of native plants.  The crew in cooperation with biologists  monitored the planting sites for survival and growth for three years after planting.  Along with riparian planting and maintenance the crew was available for fencing livestock out of streams and working on minor road enhancement work.",5/15/2002,3/29/2006,Restoration,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians," $ 890,000.00 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=01-1429,Stillaguamish River LE
01-1430,Higgins Creek Instream,"The Stillaguamish Tribe partnered with the US Forest Service to strategically place large woody debris (LWD) in and along a 1.5 mile reach of Higgins Creek, a tributary to Deer Creek in the North Fork Stillaguamish. The project utilized 343 pieces of wood in 28 sites to reinforce and resemble natural accumulations of debris. Both the stream channel and riparian area adjacent to this reach lack large diameter trees for LWD recruitment due to past timber harvest and channel clean-out. Logs were placed by helicopter in or along the channel to enhance wood recruitment and point bar formation.   This project focused on high summer water temperatures and loss of pools for holding and rearing of bull trout/Dolly Varden and on high summer water temperatures and degradation of spawning and rearing habitat for steelhead. Through assessments of the Higgins Creek sub-basin, 4.6 miles of anadromous habitat have been identified as refugia, where habitat recovery can be accomplished within a fairly short time period (Stilly Watershed Reach Assessment-SIRC, Collins et al 1995).   The net effect of this project will be reduced stream temperature and improved fish habitat. Bull trout, steelhead and coho utilize Higgins Creek, while Chinook, pink, chum, and sea-run cutthroat trout utilize lower Deer Creek.

02-1589,Smoke Farm North Floodplain Acq & Rest,"Forterra (formerly Cascade Land Conservancy) partnered with Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), Snohomish County (SC), and the landowners to protect and restore the Smoke Farm North Floodplain. Funding from NRCS leveraged SRFB funding by contributing approximately 75% of the fee simple value of the land and the majority of restoration funding. The Smoke Farm North Floodplain Restoration project acquired a Wetland Reserve Program easement and remainder fee interest on 130 acres of floodplain.  It planted 15 acres of existing side channel habitat on the property with native vegetation and conducted a hydrologic study for future dike breaching restoration.  All three components were required in order to promote full restoration of floodplain connectivity and complexity, including a ¾-mile stretch along the North Fork Stillaguamish River northeast of Arlington, WA. The property supports features critical for maintaining habitat-forming processes, including 50 acres of riparian forest that contribute LWD, a side channel slough, and an active beaver dam.   The Smoke Farm project sought to address limiting factors of the North Fork Stillaguamish. Side-channel sloughs and active beaver ponds, such as those found on Smoke Farm, provide rearing habitat and refugia for juvenile coho and other salmonids. Over 85% of beaver ponds and 31% of side channel sloughs have been eliminated due to diking and filling, and over 90% of historic riparian habitat has been eliminated. This project helped to restore and maintain rearing habitat and refugia, floodplain connectivity and complexity, and historic riparian diversity that are critical for maintaining and creating high-quality habitat for Chinook, coho, chum, cutthroat, steelhead, and bull trout.

02-1596,Little Deer Erosion Control,"Snohomish Conservation District partnered with the US Forest Service to provide controlled drainage along 13.85 miles of Little Deer Road System to reduce risk of road failure, erosion, and sediment production, and to reduce effects on fish habitat (egg-to-fry survival/rearing survival) and water quality in Little Deer Creek (Deer Creek is listed as temperature sensitive, WA 303d). Little Deer Creek is a major tributary to Deer Creek (an important tributary to the North Fork Stillaguamish River). Bull trout, steelhead and coho utilize Little Deer Creek, while chinook, pink, chum, and sea run cutthroat trout utilize lower Deer Creek. Little Deer Creek has 10 miles of anadromous and resident fish habitat, and has been identified as refugia for steelhead, coho, and char in the Deer Creek basin.   This project applied various treatments, including the addition and/or replacement of culverts, fill stabilization, installation of water bars, and removal of road prism where needed for stability. These treatments are expected to improve water quality and reduce the risk of landslides/sediment delivery. This action is expected to contribute to the incremental reduction of road-associated failures and other sedimentation that is occurring from water collection and concentration. Better spawning, egg to fry survival, rearing and holding habitat conditions for salmon and other aquatic species will result. Monitoring has been an ongoing part of this restoration effort.

02-1606,Pentland Creek/Smoke Farm Rearing,"Snohomish Conservation District used this funding to restore instream and riparian habitat on Pentland Creek and the North Fork Stillaguamish River on the southwest (downstream) lobe of Smoke Farm.  Pentland Creek enters the river approximately 5.3 miles upstream from the confluence of the north and south forks of the Stillaguamish.   Part of the project occurred on Pentland Creek from its confluence with the North Fork Stillaguamish River upstream approximately 3000 feet to the point where it flows off the valley wall.  This section of Pentland Creek had been ditched along the hillside, presumably for the purpose of maximizing agricultural use of the floodplain.   Restoration also took place on the North Fork Stillaguamish River on the eastern portion of the lobe.  Bank armoring in this area had prevented natural channel avulsion and side-channel formation and maintenance.    Restoration activities included:   1. Re-locating Pentland Creek into a more natural, meandering channel on a NRCS Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) easement south of its present location; 2. Reconnecting the creek to its floodplain;  3. Placing large woody material in newly created channel;  4. Establishing a riparian forest along the newly created channel and along the North Fork Stillaguamish River; and,  5. Removing riprap from the banks of the North Fork Stillaguamish River.  The project provides rearing habitat for coho, chum, and pink salmon and cutthroat trout, and potential rearing habitat for Chinook. Partners included Snohomish County, the Stillaguamish Clean Water District, and Stillaguamish Tribe.

02-1609,Skykomish R Braided Reach Restore Assess,"The Skykomish River between the cities of Goldbar and Sultan is known as the braided reach. As gradient decreases, sediment that is transported from the steeper, confined channels of the upper basin deposits and forms a multi-threaded channel. This dynamic environment has created broad gravel bars and complex off-channel areas that are heavily utilized by Chinook salmon and other salmonids for spawning and rearing. Recognizing the importance of this reach for salmon conservation, the Snohomish Basin Salmon Recovery Forum identified it as a ""Focus Area"" in the Near Term Action Agenda (NTAA). The NTAA outlines an interim strategy for salmon conservation, while the long-term conservation plan is under development.  While high quality habitat is still intact along portions of the braided reach, other areas have been highly modified. Habitat conditions that have been substantially degraded include access to habitat, hydrology, water quality, riparian conditions and floodplain connectivity (SBSRTC, in prep.). To address these problems effectively, while acknowledging and addressing human concerns, we have conducted a comprehensive reach-scale analysis. It included data collection and analysis of channel morphology, floodplain topography, hydrology, hydraulics, riparian conditions and habitat for salmonids. The goals was to fill data gaps and to flesh out the ideas proposed in the near-term strategy into effective projects that work with habitat forming processes. Habitat, fish use, and geomorphic assessments were completed and used to identify projects that work with natural processes to augment or create salmonid habitat.

02-1623,Snohomish R Confluence Reach Restoration,"Snohomish County used this funding for a reach scale restoration effort, on three miles of the Snohomish River, downstream from the confluence of the Skykomish and Snoqualmie rivers. . Recognizing the importance of this area to Chinook salmon and other salmonids for spawning, rearing holding and migration, the Snohomish Basin Salmon Recovery forum identified it as a ""focus area"" in the Near Term Action Agenda (SBSRF, 2002).  The project used a phased approach, with activities at three different project sites, 1) Bob Heirmann Wildlife Park, 2) Twin Rivers Park and 3) Crabb Bend. We pursued the following activities: • Planting with 12-15 ft. tall trees and cottonwood posts. • Placement of LWD • Construction of LWD complexes • Reconnection of side channel • Final design of dike breaches The dike breach design work, placement of LWD, riprap removal, and side channel reconnection work is based on an analysis of the reach conducted by Snohomish County and included 2-D modeling of the reach.  During and following construction activities, two dikes in the area were analyzed for the position and magnitude of possible dike breaches. As luck would have it, during the November 2006 flood event on the Snohomish, one Dike breached in the location where the hydraulic model had predicted the maximum amount of sheer stress. Funding has since been secured to complete the dike breaching, which will eventually return much of the area to fully functioning riverine condition.  During the latter part of construction of the Twin Rivers side channel, an opportunity arose to assist with the installation of a substantial flood fence on the Skykomish River at Groeneveld Slough. Approximately 980 cottonwood boles were placed, and during the many high water events since that time, they have successfully withstood removal and have racked up a great deal of woody material, as designed ",1/1/2004,11/12/2009,Restoration,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,Snohomish County of," $ 616,572.74 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=02-1623,Snohomish Basin LE

The objective of the project was to restore riverine processes to allow the river to regain historic habitat complexity. The primary impediment to natural processes in the reach is the presence of a substantial levee. The design work focused on removing the levee, while retaining protection for critical infrastructure in the vicinity, specifically a major King County road arterial several hundred feet behind the levee. The project restored connectivity between the river and seven acres of its floodplain.

The project site, owned by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, is one mile east of Everett, Washington.  Restoration on the site was accomplished by removing existing levees, filling drainage ditches, and re-establishing old tidal sloughs and channels.    Specifically, the project: 1. Restored tidal processes on the northern portion of Spencer Island 2. Allowed fish access to the project site by breaching the levees, removing tidegates, and restoring tidal channel connections with Union Slough and Steamboat Slough 3. Restored wetland plant communities by re-establishing natural hydrological processes and planting native vegetation. 4. Provided highly productive rearing habitat for Chinook and other salmon by restoring approximately 400 acres of previously unavailable estuarine wetlands 5. Improved floodplain function in the lower Snohomish River by increasing capacity through removing dikes on Spencer Island. This has provided an additional 400 acres of habitat that can be inundated during normal high tide and river flooding events. 6. Improved habitat complexity and connectivity for salmon by breaching the levee at the natural connection point for two main tidal channels. 7. Improved habitat conditions for waterfowl and other fish and wildlife species. 8. Maintained public access to the site for recreational opportunities, including hunting, bird watching, hiking, and wildlife photography, and nature study. Portions of the existing levee were modified as access trails onto the island.  All required permits were obtained by fall of 2007 and on the ground restoration was completed during the fall/winter of 2007-2008.

04-1587,Qwuloolt Estuary Restoration - Phase II 04,"Tulalip Tribe used this grant to plan to restore estuarine processes to 300+ acres and restore natural hydrologic connection to two stream systems in the Snohomish River Delta.  Objectives included (1) removal or breaching of dikes to restore estuarine intertidal processes, (2) removal of tide gates on Allen Creek and Jones Creek.  The Qwuloolt Project is adjacent to the City of Marysville, along Ebey Slough in the lower Snohomish River, located in one of the focus areas for near term actions and addresses all the actions suggested in the Interim Habitat Protection Restoration Strategy for this focus area.  Increasing the amount of tidal marsh, habitat complexity, and reducing habitat fragmentation will provide significant improvements in Chinook salmon abundance, productivity, and diversity.  Implementation of this project will occur in four phases: Phase 1 - feasibility, property acquisition, and studies; Phase 2 - alternatives development, environmental and public review, and studies; Phase 3 - permitting, design, and construction; Phase 4 - Monitoring.  This project will use SRFB funds to implement Phase 2 of this project, development of alternatives, environmental and public review, and complete studies necessary to estimate construction costs. Loss of habitat in to the lower Snohomish River estuary has been significant, only 17% of the area remains.

04-1634,Steelhead Haven Landslide Remediation,"The Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians used this funding to isolate the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River from the Steelhead Haven landslide and eliminate it as a significant source of fine sediment input. This was accomplished by constructing a large crib-wall structure at the toe of the landslide and by building a large sediment retention pond to store fine sediment before it entered the river through a series of gravel berms. One of the primary factors limiting Chinook production in the Stillaguamish watershed is fine sediment input before and during spawning and incubation. As stated by the Washington Department of Fisheries in the 1970's, ""The principal factor limiting salmon production within the North Fork is sedimentation resulting from a major clay slide. Below that point, heavy silt deposits cover most of the gravel riffles, making them unsuitable for successful spawning and egg incubation. This condition also inhibits natural cycles of aquatic insect growth, reducing food production, and consequently lowering the holding and rearing capacity of the stream below."" Sediment from the slide filled pools and made the overall channel network shallower and wider, which resulted in increased temperature from reduced shading and groundwater interception. Improving habitat and water quality required that the sediment source was reduced and that channel storage was increased.  A feasibility report for the project had been completed previously (#99-1687N). Turbidimeter measurements were made before and after construction above and below the project site. The meters recorded 24/7 throughout the project and beyond. Reducing sediment to a level the river can flush will be the measure of the project’s effectiveness, along with increased spawning and survival. Surveys of spawning Chinook after construction downstream of the landslide treatment showed more fish use than had been seen in the prior three decades.",3/31/2005,10/29/2010,Restoration,Closed Completed,Salmon State Projects,Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians," $ 1,008,781.19 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=04-1634,Stillaguamish River LE
04-1651,Leque Island Estuary Restoration,"Ducks Unlimited (DU) completed a feasibility study and required groundwater monitoring and modeling to restore between approximately 115 acres of estuarine intertidal vegetated wetlands (i.e setback levee design) to full tidal restoration (i.e. 294 acres; no setback levee) on the Leque Island Unit of the Skagit Wildlife Area between the mouth of the West and South Forks of the Stillaguamish River.  As part of the feasibility study Ducks Unlimited and partners completed geotechnical investigations, 90% design, hydrodynamic modeling, and nearly completed environmental permitting for the originally proposed 115 acre setback levee design.  Historically, the land was intertidal estuary wetland with associated tideflats.  However, the Stillaguamish estuary was dramatically impacted by settlement and approximately 85% of the Stillaguamish tidal marsh was converted to agriculture between 1870 and 1968.  The property was diked, tide-gated and drained for agriculture in the 1930’s resulting in the loss of estuarine marsh habitat that was essential habitat for juvenile salmon and was heavily used by wintering waterfowl and other wetland dependent species.  ""High salt marshes"" once provided for the habitat needs of several juvenile salmon species, including federally listed Skagit and Stillaguamish stocks.  The property is now owned by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and is open for public recreation. This type of project has been identified as a high priority action in several local salmon recovery plans.  The entire complex will be managed for fish, wildlife, and public recreation.    In June 2011 DU sumitted a change type request to modify the Leque Island Estuary Restoration agreement from a construction project to a feasibility study, enabling DU to complete the EPA required groundwater study.  Between August and September 2011, EPA solicited comment from the technical team on the revised scope.  Concurrently, DU was beginning to gain access to private lands required for the proposed study and landowner access to the northern transect was denied (i.e. north of SR 532).  EPA later determined that enough data on flow direction could be obtained from two transects south of SR 532 on the Camano lowlands.  On October 19, 2011 EPA approved the final well transects, locations, and scope of work.  Pacific Groundwater Group (PGG) and DU began drilling wells, installing and surveying groundwater monitoring equipment, and gathering data in late November 2011.  The study was complete by December 2012, upon which PGG produced a final report which is attached.  PGG's scope of work included: compilation/review of existing hydrogeologic data, drilling and installation of 8 monitoring wells in 2 east-west transects across the study area monitoring site; preparation of 3 hydrogeologic cross sections across the study area; monitoring of water levels and salinity in the referenced wells; estimation of aquifer properties based on hydraulic testing; interpretation of the collected data; and modeling analyses to assess the potential impacts to Camano Island groundwater.  PGG's scope of work met all requirements set forth by the EPA, and was soon expanded after project initiation to include monitoring of water levels and salinity in ditches on the monitoring site and on Leque Island.  PGG's analysis suggests that the proposed restoration will not cause further groundwater salinization beneath Camano Island.  Results can be found in PGG's final report and will be generally described here.  The monitoring site was selected by the technical team under the premise that increased potential for saltwater intrusion beneath Camano Island due to the proposed restoration is unlikely if hydrogeologic analysis shows groundwater discharge from Camano Island towards the Leque lowland.  PGG observed a horizontal groundwater gradient from Camano Island towards Leque Island and an upward gradient beneath the monitoring site.  This suggests the monitoring site and Leque Island are areas of groundwater discharge.  Salinity monitoring revealed groundwater and ditch water on the monitoring site are brackish and similar to Port Susan and the surrounding estuary.  The observed similarity between groundwater and estuarine salinity suggests that increased inundation frequency on a restored Leque Island will not significantly change groundwater salinities beneath the Leque lowland.  PGG developed a 3-D groundwater flow model to evaluate whether the estimated Leque Island groundwater level rise would cause existing groundwater flow from Camano Island to the Leque lowland to reverse direction.  Results of the predictive simulations showed no reversal of groundwater flow from Camano Island to the Leque lowland. The 3-D model predicted less than 0.1 feet of increased groundwater levels beneath upland Camano Island adjacent to the Leque lowland. Although nominal, increased groundwater heads generally result in reduced potential for saltwater intrusion because higher freshwater hydraulic heads cause the saltwater interface to deepen, thereby thickening the freshwater lens.",1/1/2005,10/1/2013,Planning,Closed Completed,Salmon State Projects,Ducks Unlimited Inc," $ 493,799.24 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=04-1651,Stillaguamish River LE

05-1078,Snoqualmie Falls Forest Theater - 0 Cr.,"The project will open ¾ mile of pristine spawning and rearing habitat to coho, steelhead and cutthroat trout on O Creek, a tributary in a nearly pristine section of the Snoqualmie River, just downstream from Snoqualmie Falls. The barrier to fish migration is an old log ford, 150 yards upstream from the creek's confluence with the Snoqualmie.  There is an existing dual road crossing, one on top of the other.  The lower crossing is an old log ford consisting of logs half buried in the streambed.  These logs are acting as a low dam of approximately 4 foot drop that creates a passage barrier.  Four bed control sills will be installed to limit the re-grade, minimizing the amount of sediment delivered downstream to the river where Chinook redds are present.  Removal of the logs and installation of four rock weirs will be completed with a tracked excavator.  This will limit incision of the upstream channel to about 3 feet in depth near the bridge crossing.  This will also steepen the upstream channel and mobilize some of the silt and sand creating better spawning conditions.  Equipment will not have to operate in the flowing stream; a bypass will be installed.  Banks will be sloped and replanted with a variety of native vegetation.

05-1511,Snohomish Estuary Edge Enhancement Proj.,"Snohomish County used this funding to place 108 pieces of large woody material with root wads in 18 jams at two sites along the lower Snohomish River known as Field's Riffle and Norwegian Bay. We controlled and removed Japanese Knotweed and blackberries from ~8 acres of riparian area and replanted ~4.5 acres of riparian forest with a mix of native species. Road fill was also removed at Field's Riffle to reconnect 2.3 acres of wetland with the Snohomish River. Enhancement actions were completed along approximately three-quarters of a mile of shoreline. The sites are owned by Snohomish County  The Snohomish lower main stem and estuary provide critical habitat for Chinook and other salmonids. Juvenile salmon use the productive marsh and edge habitat for rearing. Reduced habitat capacity and productivity from the loss of ~85% of the tidal marsh, reduced channel edge complexity from armoring and removal of ~20,000 large woody debris (LWD) pieces is hypothesized to be a primary limiting factor for Chinook salmon populations. Habitat-population performance modeling completed for the Snohomish Basin Salmon Conservation Plan predicts substantial gains in Chinook viability from estuary habitat restoration and LWD jam placement. The Plan identifies restoration of rearing habitat in the estuary and lower mainstem as a primary focus of the recovery strategy. Although several large estuarine marsh restoration projects are in the planning and implementation phases along the sloughs, no projects have been implemented along the highly-modified mainstem channel in the tidally-influenced zone. With high salmon densities passing down the main stem, the lack of main-stem habitat is cause for concern.

05-1514,Smith Island Estuary Acquisition,"Snohomish County acquired the Rhodes property with other (non-RCO) funding. This project funded acquisition-related costs for the 85-acres property including demolition, fencing, and relocation expenses. Ultimately a portion of the property will be a part of the Smith Island estuary restoration project. The Snohomish Basin Salmonid Recovery Technical Committee (1999) identified artificial barriers to access and the loss of estuarine wetlands as key factors contributing to the decline of Chinook salmon. Haas et al. (2001) estimated that the Snohomish estuary has lost approximately 85 percent of its tidal marsh and at least 50 percent of its smolt production capacity for Chinook since the late 19th century. Consequently, the estuary may commonly constrain the Snohomish River basin's production of Chinook salmon. The Rhodes property is adjacent to the 269-acre property (also purchased from the Rhodes family) with SRFB funding in 2001. Combining these acres will increase the total potential restoration area, and would include reconnection of a second large blind tidal channel - key Chinook salmonid habitat for rearing, sheltering and transitioning physiologically from fresh to saltwater. Restoration would include breaching existing dikes, setback dike construction, large woody debris supplementation, native revegetation, increasing edge habitat complexity, and providing public access and interpretive opportunities. This project has been explicitly highlighted in the Snohomish Basin Salmon Recovery Plan.

05-1521,Raging River Preston Reach Rest./Acq.,"In 1964, a levee was constructed along the Raging River, just downstream of the community of Preston. The levee disconnected the river from 7 acres of floodplain and confined it to a narrow, straight alignment. Prior to levee construction, the reach experienced frequent channel migration. Historic aerial photos show two distinct complex channel formations in 1937 and 1960. Since the 1960s, the channel has maintained a simple alignment. Specific impacts to aquatic habitat conditions include: Elimination of side channels, reducing spawning, rearing and refuge habitat Reduction in pool area, reducing rearing habitat Elimination of mature riparian vegetation, reducing LWD delivery, shading, and cover and  An increase in substrate particle size resulting in reduced spawning area.   This project restored habitat by removing the levee.  Boulders were placed at the fringe of the floodplain to protect the toe of the county road. The boulders are designed to provide roughness that will reduce the water velocity, preventing the river from scouring the slope. The resulting restoration of river processes led to the reestablishment of prime spawning and rearing habitat in the reach.

Work sites were selected according to guidance provided in several documents, primarily the Stillaguamish Watershed Chinook Salmon Recovery Plan. Activities at a site included control of noxious weeds, planting native species, monitoring, and completing annual weed control to achieve a survival rate of 80% at 3 years.  Planting plans at each site varied in species composition of native plants, planting density, and stock size to optimize plant survival.    All fish species in the Stillaguamish watershed will ultimately benefit, however primary emphasis was placed on sites where Chinook salmon spawn, migrate, and mature.  Riparian buffers will provide shade, feed, refuge from floods, and large woody debris recruitment for Chinook and other salmonids. Project success came from utilizing an experienced, organized crew of dedicated inmates under professional supervision. The crew completed weed control and planting efforts crucial to effective site restoration.

05-1564,Primary Sources of Fine Sediment,"Snohomish County used this funding to complete the study, “Primary Sources of Fine Sediment in the South Fork of the Stillaguamish.”. The work completed included 1) collecting fine sediments in artificial redds in known spawning areas of the SF Stillaguamish Rivers and tributaries and characterizing the timing of delivery and physical characteristics, 2) characterizing the known and suspected sources of fine sediment, 3) sampling Total Suspended Solids in the water column to connect sources and redds, and 4) identifying and ranking sources according to the amount of fine sediments they are delivering to redds during the time that juvenile or eggs are in the gravel. The study was explicitly and specifically designed to provide the basis for ranking individual sediment sources for treatment based on their contribution to decreased survival of ESA-listed juvenile Chinook salmon. A ranked list of sources and recommended capital projects was the final project deliverable.  ESA-listed Stillaguamish Fall Chinook salmon populations are at extremely low numbers. Technical experts and habitat model runs (Ecosystem Diagnosis and Treatment) indicate that juvenile survival is limiting production, and that fine sediment intruded into redds, causing suffocation and/or entombment, is a major source of juvenile mortality. Expensive, difficult and time-consuming sediment reduction projects are partly addressing likely sources of fine sediments, but it is unknown if these efforts will be sufficient to significantly increase juvenile survival. This had been identified as a data gap in the Stillaguamish Lead Entity Strategy.

05-1588,Segelsen Road Erosion Control Project,"Snohomish Conservation District partnered with US Forest Service on this project to reduce risk of road failure, erosion, and sediment production and its negative effects on fish habitat in the North Fork Stillaguamish watershed. The project reduced impacts directly to Segelsen Creek, Cascade Creek, and south branch of the North Fork Stillaguamish and indirectly to the North Fork Stillaguamish.   This project consisted of 175 culvert replacements, ditching, and fill stabilization, and it addressed 12.3 miles of road, focusing on treatment of high-risk drainage deficiencies. Expected results included water quality improvements, reduction in the risk of landslides/sediment delivery, reduction of road-associated failures and other sedimentation. This project targeted the limiting factor of sedimentation and its effects on egg to fry survival for Chinook, coho, steelhead and Dolly Varden.  The Stillaguamish Lead Entity Strategy (2004) identifies forest roads that are underlain by unstable geology and on greater than 30% slopes as presenting increased risk of sediment routing to streams and rivers. Sediment transported from upland areas and from within the channel determines the nature and quality of salmonid habitat in streams and rivers.

05-1605,"North Meander Reconnection, Phase II","The North Meander Reconnection Project, completed in 2010, provides 3100 feet of off-channel rearing habitat for juvenile salmonids in the mainstem Stillaguamish River.  Almost 70% of the off-channel rearing habitat in the mainstem has been lost due to the construction of levees and revetments, and the removal of gravel and LWD.  Historically these side channels provided key areas for Chinook and coho juveniles to rear.  The North Meander is a river bend cut off by a channel straightening project on Cook Slough in the 1930s.  The upper end was plugged and over time the lower end filled in with sediments, eventually leaving a depressional wetland with no hydraulic connection to the river.    The project consists of a box culvert inlet from Cook Slough, excavation of an inlet channel to connect to the upper end of the meander, excavation of the meander, and connection of an outlet to the Stillaguamish River.

The project built upon the Braided Reach Restoration Assessment, which identified strategic points in the reach that would serve to reduce intervention impacts while maximizing results.  This helped implement cost conservative projects at locations where the best results were achieved with a minimal expenditure of funding and energy, maximizing the potential of the system itself to create and preserve essential habitat and habitat functions.    The accomplishments of this phase consisted of:  1. Augmenting an existing log jam to provide refuge, create holding pools, and to add complexity and edge habitat. 2. Instream flood fencing at 32 selected locations that increased channel roughness and complexity.  (Flood fencing is a bioengineering technique.  This technique creates small scale roughness features spanning a large area, whereas large wood jams create large roughness elements over a small area)   The intent of this project was to enhance juvenile salmonid rearing habitat.  Wood structures were designed and located to encourage the development and reconnection of off-channel habitat, to increase edge habitat, and promote further log jam development.

06-2250,Chinook Bend Levee Removal 06,"King County restored floodplain habitat along the Snoqualmie River by removing a levee that prevented the river from accessing its floodplain on the Chinook Bend Natural Area.  The county-owned property consists of 59 acres entirely within the 100-year floodplain. This project removed 1700 feet of levee and bank armoring and an additional 1300 feet of revetment to allow the river to access its floodplain at much lower flows. The material was disposed of off-site or used for farm pads in the valley.  The disturbed area was graded to approximate historic bank conditions.  Disturbed soils were amended and stabilized to reduce the potential for erosion by hydroseeding with native species and planting native trees, predominantly cottonwood and alder.    Design and permitting of the levee removal project took place in 2007 and the first half of 2008.  Project construction was broken into 2 phases.  The first phase of construction (in 2008) included placement of large diameter cottonwood boles in strategic locations in the floodplain to create areas that slow flow and resist deep scour. Phase 1 is intended to prevent excessive channel widening, which can be a risk in altered floodplain settings. Additionally, approximately 50 pieces of large wood were installed to expedite the natural recruitment of wood. The second phase of the project removed the revetments and levees in summer 2009 and 2011.  The project is expected to restore rearing habitat in close proximity to productive spawning habitat and along the outmigration corridor for nearly the entire population of the Snoqualmie run of Snohomish Fall Chinook.  The WRIA 7 Chinook conservation plan calls for removal of levees and other obstructions that hinder the formation of off channel rearing habitat.  Implementation of this project will be a significant step toward achieving the Snohomish River Basin Salmon Conservation Plan goal of restoring 80 acres of off channel habitat in the highest priority areas of the Snoqualmie watershed.

06-2251,Camp Gilead Reconnection Design 06,"This project completed designs and permitting for a levee removal on county-owned property along the Snoqualmie River (at RM 23).  The 115 foot long levee has effectively severed the floodplain wetland from its relationship to the Snoqualmie River, and impounds a small tributary, a wetland and a historic backwater channel of the Snoqualmie, creating a single open water wetland.  Under present conditions, the two habitats are only connected during extremely high flows a few hours to a few days per year.  In a subsequent phase of the project (2008 or 2009) the segment of levee will be removed to restore 4 acres of off-channel habitat.  The county is also considering removing bank armoring along an additional 300 feet of revetment adjacent to the levee segment that will be removed.   For fish, the benefit will be substantial. The wetland will provide excellent rearing and refuge habitat for juvenile salmonids.

Weed control was accomplished on 17 acres and 12 acres were revegetated with native plants.  The reach was identified as a priority salmon recovery reach in the Snohomish River Basin Salmon Recovery Plan (2005).  The project assisted farmers in achieving and maintaining ""Salmon-Safe"" certification, an emerging Northwest labeling program that recognizes fish-friendly farming practices in the marketplace.  Salmon-Safe certification provides credibility, exposure, and marketing opportunities for participating farmers, and also serves to educate a broad constituency about salmon recovery in the agricultural landscape.  The restoration projects established and maintained riparian habitat along the Snoqualmie River by removing invasive species and planting native vegetation.  The target reaches are identified as prioity sub-basins in the Snohomish Salmon Plan and provide prime spawning habitat for Chinook salmon and rearing habitat for steelhead.  The collaborative approach and market-based Salmon-Safe program is also identified as a target strategy in the Plan and other regional salmon recovery efforts.

07-1701,Cherry Creek Floodplain Restoration,"Cherry Creek is the Snoqualmie River’s lowest major tributary; its location provides high recovery-benefit potential for chinook, coho, and other salmonids. The ditching and straightening of the lower mainstem and floodplain tributaries has compromised salmon habitat in the Cherry / Snoqualmie floodplain, reducing the availability of off channel high-flow refugia, juvenile rearing areas, and adult spawning grounds. Through its 3rd Round SRFB-funded feasibility study (01-1304N), Wild Fish Conservancy (WFC) prioritized actions to improve salmon habitat in Cherry Valley. During the study WFC worked closely with King County Drainage District #7, WDFW, and NOAA Fisheries.  To address compromised habitat conditions in lower Cherry Creek Valley, WFC and partners consolidated three floodplain ditches into a single naturalized stream channel, installed a bridge to provide access to service the existing pump station, and planted a riparian buffer of native trees and shrubs. This project, located within the Mainstem-Primary Restoration Strategy Group, will improve instream and riparian habitat diversity and complexity for nearly one mile of channel within the Cherry Creek floodplain.

The restoration work includes breaching up to 5,000 linear feet of dikes, building up to 9,100 linear feet of set back dikes, filling/blocking a drainage ditch network, enhancing tidal channels and their connection to Union Slough, adding logjams, enhancing edge habitat complexity, and planting native vegetation. The project ultimately will restore more than 400 acres of tidal marsh, a significant percentage of the 1,200-acre target in the Snohomish Basin Salmon Conservation Plan. The project will help address the loss of about 85 percent of the basin’s estuarine wetlands, a key factor contributing to the decline of Chinook salmon.

07-1708,Stillwater Wildlife Area Floodplain Restoration,"This grant funded the conceptual design of a project that restores natural processes to a suite of floodplain habitats in the Stillwater reach of the Snoqualmie River. The Stillwater reach of the Snoqualmie River offers an important opportunity for process restoration in a large area of publicly owned mainstem habitat. This reach is also significant because it includes the entire floodplain wetland complex associated with the junction of Harris Creek, a major anadromous tributary.  Currently, habitat forming processes in the Stillwater reach are impaired by bank hardening, a lack of large woody debris, and reduced riparian forest cover. This project developed a geomorphic reach analysis that  was used to inform restoration conceptual designs.  Elements of restoration design that were assessed through this analysis included: the location and extent of large wood enhancement, the amount of riprap removal required for the re-establishment of alluvial migration processes, and ideal locations for riparian forest plantings.  The restoration design derived from the geomorphic reach assessment will be implemented by the project partners, in phase 2 of the project. Project partners include the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, King County, the Stilly-Snohomish Fisheries Enhancement Task Force, Ducks Unlimited, and the Wild Fish Conservancy.

07-1709,Skykomish Braided Reach Restoration-Ph II,"This project built on the SRFB funded Braided Reach Restoration Assessment (02-1609N), which identified strategic points in the reach that would serve to reduce intervention impacts while maximizing results.  Limiting factors in the reach include flood and low flows, lack of refuge and rearing habitat, and lack of pool habitat.  Rearing and refuge habitat have been diminished due to railroad and highway construction, which has reduced overall floodplain area.    The 18 wood structures placed in this this phase consisted of:    a) Wood complexes to provide refuge, create holding pools, and add complexity and edge habitat.    b) Flood fencing at selected locations to increase channel roughness and complexity.    With this suite of projects, we increased edge habitat on the mainstem, reconnected side channels, improved riparian conditions and created pools.  River processes were neither changed nor “improved”, but themselves used to improve habitat, in much the same way that habitat is altered in natural systems.  Rather than relying on large-scale interventions, the approach used the power of the river to affect habitat creation.  In this way, long-term benefits will be realized that build upon the foundations laid down by the completed projects.",1/1/2008,7/2/2012,Restoration,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,Snohomish County of," $ 260,602.75 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=07-1709,Snohomish Basin LE
07-1714,Pilchuck River Riparian/Fish Habitat Restoration,"The Stilly-Snohomish Fisheries Enhancement Task Force restored 5.75 acres of riparian forests and enhanced approximately 2,500 lineal feet (within one mile of stream length) of the Pilchuck River shoreline near Lake Stevens to improve sub-optimal habitat for ESA listed Chinook salmon and steelhead, as well as chum, coho, pink salmon, and cutthroat trout.   In cooperation with private agricultural landowners, Snohomish County, and Snohomish Conservation District, the project funded construction of a large instream wood structure and a flood fence at Site A (Attachment #5), an area of accelerated bank erosion. Installing wood structures is expected to benefit fish by increasing habitat complexity for juvenile salmonids and decrease local sediment input to spawning areas. Shortly after construction, the structure sustained significant flood damage and was not replaced. The sponsor completed 30% designs for 3 new instream wood structures, at Sites B & C and for repairs to Site A.  The project also funded invasive weed control and native vegetation planting to establish a ~50 foot riparian buffer on 5.75 acres at Sites A and C in order to shade the channel and provide organic material input to support natural river processes when trees mature.

07-1735,Blue Slough Side Channel Reconnection ,"The Stillaguamish Tribe used this project to reconnect a 2500' remnant side channel that was disconnected from the mainstem North Fork Stillaguamish in the 1930s when the railroad built tracks between the channel and the river. During this time the river downcut and the side channel (slough) filled with organic debris and fine sediment from associated land uses such as logging and livestock grazing.  The initial two phases of this project removed a 2-3 foot layer of ""muck"" and enough bed material to put the channel at the elevation of the river. The final phase of construction installed new corrugated metal culverts to connect the slough to the river at both ends allowing continuous flow through the channel and providing winter and summer rearing for chinook juveniles. In addition, a log jam complex was installed near the upstream culvert to provide backwater refugia for smolts entering the side channel.  Riparian areas were planted with a mix of native conifer, hardwood, and conifers upon completion of the project.    Numerous studies have shown a dramatic decline in the miles of side channel habitat throughout the watershed (Pess et.al. 2000, Sno. Co. SWM 2000-2003). This project opened up 2500 feet of side channel with associated wetlands and riparian habitat. This project created critical rearing and refuge habitat during winter storm events. Currently less than 2% of Chinook salmon juveniles rear in fresh water for a year before going out to sea (Griffith et al. 2005). By re-connecting quality side channel habitat, we expect to increase the survival of fish using this life history trajectory. During the two seasons since construction fish surveys have documented the use of the side channel by Chinook, Coho and Chum salmon.

07-1736,Lower Pilchuck Instream & Riparian Restoration,"The Stillaguamish Tribe previously acquired a 65-acre parcel of floodplain land along Pilchuck Creek, near its confluence with the mainstem Stillaguamish River in Arlington, WA (the Creek flows through the center of the parcel). Over the last one hundred years, the land within the project area had been cleared, graded, farmed, turned into a dirt bike track and significantly altered from its historic condition.  The banks of Pilchuck Creek had been hardened and pushed closer to the water, simplifying and constraining the channel.  Adjacent wetlands had been ditched and drained, and the riparian vegetation had been removed from all but a small strip of immature trees immediately adjacent to the stream channel. Before this project was undertaken, this reach lacked high quality habitat for the threatened Stillaguamish fall Chinook salmon population.  In an effort to restore natural processes at this site,  this grant was used to undertake a project that removed 300' of bank armoring, plant 6.4 acres of riparian area, fill 200' of drainage ditch to restore wetlands, create a 1.2 acre off-channel rearing pond (0.5 ac of which were funded by SRFB) and 200' pond outlet channel, and build four logjams.  The project helped this reach of Pilchuck Creek return to properly functioning conditions and, in the process, created quality habitat for fall Chinook and all of the salmonid species passing through the project area (Coho, Chum, Pink, Steelhead, and Bull trout/Dolly Varden). In the 2005 Stillaguamish Chinook Recovery Plan, the project reach was listed as a first priority for floodplain restoration and a second tier priority for riparian restoration.

07-1737,NF Stillaguamish ELJs,"This grant by the Stillaguamish Tribe to construct 5 new logjams, purchase wood for a 6th ELJ, and repair and enhance 3 other large wood structures damaged by flood waters, in the North Fork Stillaguamish River watershed. The North Fork begins in the Cascade foothills of Skagit County and flows westerly to Arlington. The goal of this project was to create places for Chinook salmon to rest, feed, and hide from predators as they move through the river system. This project also partially funded an ELJ placement prioritization assessment (Attach. #18), analyzing data including aerial, LIDAR, infrared photography and proximity to associated acquisition and restoration projects and identify strategic ELJ locations. Three engineered log jams were placed to direct flow into remnant side channels at Hazel and downstream of French Creek and three jams were placed to split flow at the apex of a mid channel bar downstream of Hazel and downstream of French Creek. Repairs were made to the large log cribwall structure at the Steelhead Haven landslide twice during the life of this grant as well as cabling additional wood to two structures built earlier that needed some additional support. One of the critical factors limiting Chinook populations is the lack of large, deep pools where fish can rest during upstream migration and rear after emergence from the gravel. The log jams aid in the creation of quality pool habitat for holding and juvenile rearing as well as providing a lot of surface area for primary production and the capture of nutrients. New forest practice rules that protect channel migration and riparian condition are expected to provide a long-term source of wood to the river.  This project provides short-term benefit while the watershed recovers.

07-1743,SF Stillaguamish Knotweed Control ,"In the South Fork Stillaguamish Knotweed Control and Restoration project, Sound Salmon Solutions (SSS) worked with community members to restore salmon habitat in tributaries to the South Fork Stillaguamish River, including Jim, Canyon and Turlo Creeks. With an average of only 246 spawners returning annually, South Fork Stillaguamish Chinook salmon are considered on the brink of extinction. Aquatic and riparian habitat in these waterways is degraded. Lack of tree cover and spread of invasive weeds have led to elevated water temperatures, excessive sedimentation, reduced food supply, and loss of instream cover, all of which harm salmon. Knotweed, a non-native plant, was invading the the project area, creating dense monocultures that crowd out native vegetation. Knotweed regenerates from severed roots and stems, spreading easily downstream with high flows. To restore salmon habitat, knotweed was controlled and native vegetation was re-introduced to riparian areas that has a lack of native plants.  SSS worked with private landowners to control knotweed on their property along Jim, Canyon, and Turlo Creeks. From 2008 to 2011, SSS contacted 177 landowners and secured 145 land owner agreements. Community volunteers, local students, and members of the Washington Conservation Corps helped restore riparian habitat with native plants. Fourteen acres of riparian vegetation was restored with 5,439 native plants. This project improved salmon habitat by increasing shade, increasing leaf and wood input, improving bank stability, and decreasing knotweed populations. Project partners included Snohomish County Noxious Weed Control Board, Surface Water Management, Washington Department of Natural Resources, Snohomish Conservation District, Stillaguamish Cooperative Weed Management Area Members, and Washington State Department of Ecology.

07-1751,SF Stillaguamish Chinook Supplementation ,"This project was designed to enhance or improve the current South Fork Chinook, fall, population (identified as genetically distinct from the North Fork Chinook, summer, population) by implementing a wild stock supplementation program until protection and restoration of habitat and harvest restrictions recover the stock to a sustainable level. It was believed the current population is hovering around 100+ fish and the risk of extinction is very high. This project intended to increase the survival of juvenile fish primarily in the egg to fry life history stage. Data collected at the mainstem smolt trap shows that during large storm events survival in both the North and South Forks is very low, approaching zero, hence the goal of initiating a wild stock supplementation program.   Initially our goal was to capture 15-20 adult males and females and spawn them, similar to the program the Tribe has implemented on the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River.  Extensive snorkel surveys were conducted in the South Fork Stillaguamish to locate holding pools of adult Chinook.  This proved to be unsuccessful as surveyors rarely found groups of 5 or more Chinook.  Dive surveys were also conducted in the mainstem Stillaguamish and lower North Fork Stillaguamish to attempt to locate fall timed Chinook, as genetic analysis showed that fall and summer timed Chinook are mixed within the watershed.  These surveys were also unsuccessful.  Given the inability to locate large groups of adult Chinook to broodstock, staff took to floating and broodstocking in smaller holes throughout the South Fork Stillaguamish.  Only male Chinook were collected during the broodstock efforts in the South Fork Stillaguamish.  Given the difficulty in catching adult broodstock from the South Fork Stillaguamish, the Tribe took to having each adult Chinook captured out of the North Fork Stillaguamish (for the NF Stillaguamish wild stock supplemenation program) geneticly analyzed to determine assignment (i.e fall or summer timed).  Results showed there were in fact fall timed Chinook holding (and spawning) in the North Fork Stillaguamish.  Staff were able to isolate the fall timed adult Chinook and in 2010 one pair of adult fall timed Chinook were spawned.  In 2011 two females and seven male fall timed Chinook were spawned.  2010 offspring (approx 4,500) were reared at the Harvey Creek Hatchery.  They were acclimated  and released in the late spring from the newly purchased Brenner Creek Hatchery Facility (the same process will be undertaken for 2011 offspring as well).  Eventually all spawning, rearing and releasing will occur at the Brenner Creek Hatchery Facility once it is fully operational (intial work has begun).  Our intention was to release approximately 50-60,000 fry to increase their ability to survive long enough to migrate to, and four years later return from, the sea. All outgoing juveniles will be tagged and marked for later recovery and catch analysis. Given the difficulty in capturing adult broodstock it may take years to reach 50-60,000 fry release goal.  As a result of the difficulty in capturing adult broodstock, in 2009 the Tribe intiated a captive brood program for the South Fork Chinook supplementation program.  Staff seined juvenile Chinook out of the South Fork Stillaguamish.  Each fish was held individually in ""condos"" until genetic analysis was complete, to assign them to either fall or summer popoulation.  Fish that assigned to the fall population were held at Harvey Creek  Hatchery.  All broodyear 2008 fish were held at Harvey Creek Hatchery.   Approximately half of broodyear 2009 fish were transffered to the NOAA Manchester facility, a saltwater rearing compound, well-renowned for their ability to bring salmon populations back from the brink of extinction.    This grant also funded the genetic analysis that was performed on outmigrating juvenile chinook collected at the mainstem smolt trap to determine in which fork they were produced. Genetic results were able to succesffuly estimate production of smolts from each (fall, summer) population.   This grant also covered a portion of the preliminary costs associated with retrofitting the existing Brenner Creek hatchery, including permitting, security, and septic system design.

07-1760,Stillaguamish Low Flow Water Right Assess,"Wild Fish Conservancy used this grant to evaluate the feasibility of acquisition and restoration opportunities to restore and protect instream flows and habitat connectivity in the Stillaguamish River watershed.  The prioritization process assisted in directing funding to projects with the most benefit for ESA-listed fish, correctly setting the stage and completing the first sequence for implementation success.  The Stillaguamish River provides critical habitat to many fish and wildlife species including five Pacific salmon species, three of which are currently listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act (Puget Sound Chinook, Puget Sound steelhead, and bull trout).  Four sub-basins have been identified in the Stillaguamish Watershed Chinook Salmon Recovery Plan as potentially contributing to low instream flow, yet until this project was completed, there was no complete inventory or analysis of sub-basins within the watershed that are currently flow impaired under current water rights, and existing registers of water-right holders were in need of significant updating.    Funding was used to update the Dept. of Ecology’s water right database with current land ownership information within three priority sub-basins of the Stillaguamish River (Pilchuck, Harvey, and Church Creeks); conduct a literature review and field reconnaissance of existing flow conditions to identify water right projects; educate landowners on issues and concerns identified in local recovery plans and how they can help reduce impacts of low flows; and prioritize and identify at least two flow restoration and water right acquisition opportunities with individual land owners.

The 2,030-acre project area provided floodplain and riparian habitat between Boulder and Squire Creek for ESA-listed Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout, as well as pink, coho, chum, sockeye, and cutthroat. Identified in the Recovery Plan as a first-tier priority area for riparian, large wood, and hydrologic processes, as well as second tier floodplain priority, the project area provided the best functioning Chinook habitat in the North Fork Stillaguamish.  The objectives were to:  1. provide reach level and tract specific information; 2. prioritize parcels based on their habitat value for salmonids, imminent and long-term threats, and priority restoration needs;  3. assess landowner interest in conservation opportunities; 4. pending landowner interest, protect approximately 200-300 acres of floodplain and riparian salmonid habitat through acquisitions or conservation easements; and 5. conduct riparian or in-stream restoration in the project area to enhance habitat-forming processes The prioritization model that was used incorporated a modified version of the Reach Scale Protection Formula (1999) that was developed by the Skagit Watershed Council and the methodology detailed in the South Prairie Creek Action Plan (2002) developed by CLC.

07-1767,SF Stillaguamish Woody Debris Placement,"This project involved the siting, design, and construction of two (2) woody debris complexes in the lower South Fork Stillaguamish River.  A standard engineering feasibility study was completed, including designs for specific project elements.  The project is consistent with and implements the Stillaguamish Chinook Recovery Plan, 3-year Implementation Plan, recent budget requests, and a developing strategy for conservation of South Fork chinook salmon. The objective is to increase woody debris frequency in priority reaches of the Stillaguamish watershed for the purposes of increasing quantity and quality of adult holding and juvenile rearing habitat, sorting sediment, and introducing roughness to slow down the velocity and, thus, the stream (erosive) power of the river.  Installation of two (2) log jams (consisting of 50 to 60 pieces of wood each) is expected to increase the hydraulic and habitat diversity, provide excellent hiding and shade cover for juveniles migrating downstream and feeding, and potentially increase adult holding capacity. Log jams can be stable over a period of 80 years or more. This provides a critical link between current conditions and a future in which more natural log jams can occur as a result of increased recruitment of large wood due to protection and restoration measures in the Plan.

However, existing water type maps under-represent the extent of fish and fish habitat, and many streams are mapped incorrectly or not at all. Consequently, many stream channels that deserve protection under existing regulations are not receiving appropriate buffers. Surveyed watersheds were prioritized with assistance from a Guidance Team consisting of representatives from the WRIA 07 Technical Committee.  Data from the assessment has been shared and made available to resource managers and the public on the conservancy’s Website. In addition to providing data to ensure informed and responsible management of these watersheds, the conservancy identified, prioritized, and develop conceptual designs for five stream and riparian restoration / protection projects that offer the greatest likelihood of improved benefit to salmon.

Forty acres of the 54 acres in the reach were already in public ownership and are managed for salmonid habitat and public safety. King County acquired four parcels and removed three of the seven remaining residences in the reach. This is a significant step toward reaching the goal of acquiring all the properties in this floodplain area. Once this goal is reached, the revetment at the upstream end of the San Soucil neighborhood will be removed allowing the river to reoccupy floodplain channels, increasing habitat quality and quantity and restoring ecological processes.  The King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks acquired 8.03 of the remaining 14 acres of privately held habitat within the severe channel migration hazard area of the Tolt River at RM 4.5.  The acquisitions were part of a larger effort to protect and restore floodplain habitat in this area. The Tolt is one of the highest priority protection/restoration basins within WRIA 07.

08-1571,Stillaguamish Knotweed Control & Riparian Rest.,"Sound Salmon Solutions (formerly Stilly-Snohomish Fisheries Enhancement Task Force) and partners worked with community members to restore salmon habitat along the South Fork and North Fork Stillaguamish River. With an average of 7% of the historic population returning each year, Stillaguamish River Chinook are highly threatened of becoming extinct. Currently, aquatic and riparian habitat in these waterways is degraded. Lack of tree cover and the spread of invasive weeds have contributed to high water temperatures, excessive sedimentation, reduced food supply, and loss of instream cover, all of which harm salmon. Knotweed, a non-native plant, is invading the project area, creating dense monocultures and crowding out native vegetation. Knotweed regenerates from severed roots and stems, spreading easily downstream with high flows.

The Stilly-Snohomish Fisheries Enhancement Task Force, with technical support from Snohomish County Surface Water Management, conducted an assessment and design project for Tychman Slough, a two-mile long side-channel of the Skykomish River in the braided reach near Sultan.  The project assessed salmon and trout use, aquatic and riparian habitat, and hydraulic and hydrologic processes in the slough.   Land use is primarily agricultural and rural residential.  Habitat conditions within and adjacent to Tychman Slough are sub-optimal for Chinook salmon and other salmonids.  Assessment of current conditions was warranted in order to collect baseline data to inform development of a prioritized list of restoration project sites and actions. Landowners adjacent to the slough participated in the selection of future restoration project locations and designs. By working cooperatively with agricultural and rural-residential landowners and Snohomish County, the Task Force identified and prioritized restoration projects that serve a dual purpose of improving habitat conditions for salmonids and enhancing rural land.

08-1613,Canyon Creek Road Treatment Project,"The Stillaguamish Tribe partnered with the US Forest Service to develop final designs and permits for future projects intended to reduce sediment loading to stream channels from road networks on National Forest lands in the Canyon Creek Sub-basin of the Stillaguamish River.  The treatments were designed to substantially reduce the risk of road failures and erosion. This project will include culvert replacements, fill stabilization and road treatments for both the mainline and spur roads.  Canyon Creek, once a WDFW index stream for Chinook salmon, has 14 miles of anadromous fish habitat and 12 more miles of resident fish habitat. Sediment from the tributaries of Canyon Creek has negatively affected the water quality of Canyon Creek and the South Fork Stillaguamish River downstream of RM 33 since the mid-1980’s. Canyon Creek is listed as an impaired water body for elevated temperature. Excess sediment is exacerbating the temperature problem.   This proposal addressed 33 miles of high-risk Forest Service roads in the upper 60% of the South Fork Canyon Creek watershed.

08-2056,Lower Tolt River Floodplain Reconnection 08,"This grant was used to restore connectivity to the active floodplain area in the lower ½ mile of the Tolt River by setting back levees and allowing the river to flood and/or avulse into the restored floodplain area.  The WRIA 07 Recovery Strategy specifically targets levee setbacks/ removals along important spawning and rearing reaches of the major rivers in the Snohomish Basin as priority actions in its salmon habitat protection and restoration strategy (Snohomish Basin Salmon Recovery Forum, 2003, p. 15). Implementation of the Tolt project is expected to restore side channel habitat and pool and riffle character to the main channel. The general project components included: removal of 2,500 feet of levee along the right bank of the Tolt River, with construction of a new setback levee roughly 800' behind the existing levee, construction of an extensive woody debris revetment, construction of seven large engineered logjam structures and three LWD channel-roughening structures, planting of over 24,000 native trees and shrubs in the floodplain, the construction of interpretive and recreational elements to offset impacts to existing recreational uses in the park, and construction of more than 100 new parking spaces for park visitors.  Note that the recreational elements and new parking spaces were not a part of the SRFB grant, but were part of the project overall.

The island is currently fully diked, separating vast areas of former tidal wetlands from the estuary. The Snohomish River Basin Salmon Conservation Plan has determined that restoring tidal flow to former wetlands, such as this, is the most important thing that can be done to restore salmon in this watershed.   There are a number of ways this land could be used, and a variety of stakeholders are interested in restoring habitat, creating more recreational opportunities, maintaining agriculture, maintaining or improving the integrity of the dike, protecting other landowners, and protecting pipelines and roads. A large restoration project may be feasible if these interests can be addressed. This grant funded studies of the hydrology and other geophysical characteristics of the site, protection of infrastructure and neighbors, and social interests.  The study identified preferred options for restoration of the area, and satisfaction of the other interests, for several alternatives involving both no more land acquisition and likely future land acquisition possibilities.

09-1268,Nearshore Sediment Nourishment Feasibility Study,"This project helped identify, locate, and advance beach restoration in the nearshore area, targeting potential projects located along the railroad impounded shoreline south of Everett in WRIA 7 (from Pigeon Creek #1 to the unnamed stream west of Japanese Gulch in Mukilteo).  The project identified the most suitable locations for beach habitat restoration using physical, biological, and socio-economic criteria and prepared two preliminary project designs (30%) for the selected preferred alternative sites (Site #2 and Howarth Park).  The selected study reach is appropriately scaled to address landscape and ecosystem processes along a stretch of shoreline characterized by the presence of the railroad and to develop site-specific recommendations in the context of drift cell management.   In the Snohomish River Basin, restoration of Chinook juvenile rearing habitat in the Nearshore has been identified as a high priority needed for Chinook salmon recovery. Progress on beach restoration has lagged, until recently. Completion of this feasibility and preliminary design project has lead to a final design project (12-1241) that will complete engineering for five restoration sites, with the potential for restoration in 2014-2015.

The project restored natural hydrologic connection and functions to historic floodplain wetlands and two stream systems, providing unrestricted fish access to 16 miles of upstream spawning and rearing habitat. Restoration work included channel excavation and ditch filling, treatment of invasive reed canary grass, restoration and relocation of more than 1 mile of historic stream channel and construction of new tidal channels, construction of approximately 3,950 feet (8 acres) of the west setback levee, and lowering and breaching the old Ebey Slough levee, planting of riparian areas within and on the perimeter of the project, storm water and sewer facility modifications, as well as project permitting, design, and management tasks. Washington State funds contributed significantly to levee construction and supplement tribal funds to meet a 35% local cost-share obligation for working with the Corps under the Puget Sound and Adjacent Waters Program. These grant funds contributed to permitting, design and engineering, construction management, removal of 1600 ft. of old levee, stormwater facility modification and construction, sewerline modifications, 0.53 miles of channel construction, and 5.9 acres of plantings. The acres planted were less then planned because of property exchange and one landowner deciding against planting. Cultural resource assessments and planting actions were part of and completed during project planning and implementation, but were paid also paid for in part by other grant sources.

09-1279,Smith Island Estuarine Restoration - Construction,"Snohomish County completed construction of the Smith Island Estuarine Restoration project, reestablishing estuarine tidal marsh conditions to more than 300 acres of the Snohomish River estuary, northeast of Everett, WA, for the benefit of ESA-listed species including Chinook, Steelhead and Bull Trout. Restoration work highlights included: construction of a mile-long setback dike to protect adjacent agricultural properties, WA Interstate-5, and Everett Waste Water Treatment Plant infrastructure, reconnection of more than 3-1/2 miles of tidal channels to Union Slough, filling a mile of linear ditches to prevent fish stranding, installing 42 wood structures; and returning tidal inundation by breaching nearly a mile of relic dike. In addition to reestablishing critical salmon rearing habitat, this project provides opportunities for passive recreation, including non-motorized boat access, wildlife viewing, picnicking, and walking along the City of Everett levee-top trail to the south of the project area. This project has achieved more than 25% of the 10-year estuary restoration benchmark set with the 2005 Snohomish River Basin Salmon Conservation Plan.

09-1281,Snoqualmie- Fall City Reach Restoration Assessment,"The goal of this grant was to identify, quantify, and prioritize high value habitat restoration projects on the Snoqualmie River between the confluence of the Raging River and Patterson Creek near Fall City, WA. As an initial starting point, nine potential restoration projects were identified that could be implemented in this reach. This reach is one of the two core Chinook spawning areas on the Snoqualmie River where the river historically had access to off-channel areas and provided greater rearing habitat. The installation of levees and revetments in this reach along with past land use practices have substantially reduced the river’s ability to access these critical rearing areas. The project evaluated revetments, levees, roads, and other structures in this reach in an effort to set back or remove levees and revetments, restore natural processes, and increase productivity of salmonids, including ESA-listed Chinook salmon and steelhead trout. The assessment characterized reach conditions, identified potential projects, explored opportunities and constraints, compared and contrasted ecological benefits, and created a sequence for undertaking the projects.  In addition, conceptual designs were developed for five projects and a 30% design was developed for one project.

09-1282,Middle Pilchuck River Reach Assessment & Design,"The purpose of this project was to develop high priority projects to address the salmonid habitat limiting factors created by altered processes in the Middle Pilchuck sub-basin, a restoration focus area in the Snohomish Basin Salmon Conservation Plan (2005). The Pilchuck River, historically a major Chinook salmon producer, now supports only ~100 natural origin spawners per year. In order to reach the recovery goals outlined in the plan, it is critical to implement strategic projects that work with natural processes. We conducted an intensive assessment of habitat forming processes along an 18-mile reach of the river. The final report synthesizes the results of the assessment and provides guidance on project site selection, project design, and coordination among entities working in the basin. As part of this process, Snohomish County conducted targeted outreach to landowners in the intensive study area. We selected three high-priority projects and completed permit-ready 30% designs so that acquisition of construction funding and implementation can immediately follow.

09-1377,Jim Creek Restoration Design,"Sound Salmon Solutions (formerly Stilly-Snohomish Fisheries Enhancement Task Force) conducted a 30% design project for salmon habitat restoration for an approximately 1-mile reach of lower Jim Creek. Sound Salmon Solutions worked with The Watershed Company to conduct field investigations to assess habitat conditions and processes within the reach and develop conceptual designs (roughly 30% level designs) for future restoration projects. Restoration designs include: protection and enhancement of two existing log jams; placement of 14 large woody debris structures; removal of rip-rap and car-body bank armoring; and riparian corridor restoration through livestock exclusion fencing & setbacks, invasive vegetation control and native plantings. The eight adjacent landowners within the project area all participated in the design process, providing feedback on project concepts and discussing locations, access, and perceived risks of implementation.  Hydrologic and preliminary hydraulic modeling of the proposed restoration activities were also completed as part of this work.    South Fork (SF) Chinook are considered to be at the threshold of extinction (Shared Strategy 2007), and Jim Creek is one of a few tributaries where SF Chinook are found (SIRC 2005). Habitat conditions within and adjacent to Jim Creek are sub-optimal for Chinook and other salmonids. The project resulted in designs for on-the-ground restoration actions that, when constructed, will contribute to improved habitat conditions for SF Chinook and other salmonids.

09-1379,Klein Farm Acquistion and Restoration,"The Stillaguamish Tribe acquired approximately 58 acres of floodplain, removed 300 feet of bank armoring, and enhanced more than 35 acres of riparian habitat on the South Fork Stillaguamish River. The project protected the land from development, restored natural channel migration and habitat forming processes in the floodplain, and will ultimately reduce stream temperatures, and provide a source of LWD for instream habitat to benefit ESA listed Chinook salmon and steelhead.  Before this project, this property was threatended by development.  The land was and still is zoned Ag-10, meaning that six houses could have been placed on the floodplain adjacent to the South Fork Stillaguamish. By purchasing and restoring floodplain functions on this piece of land, we have addressed the primary threats and problems (from a salmon perspective) that these parcels faced.   By removing the bank armoring on this parcel, we've allowed for natural channel processes to resume at this site. The protection and enhancement of the riparian areas will also help to reduce stream temperatures and provide a source of large woody debris (LWD) for instream habitat in future decades.  Restoring floodplain functions in the Stillaguamish has also been identified as a cultural priority for the Stillaguamish Tribe, and this property will serve as a place for tribal members to collect culturally important plants, and perform ceremonies.

09-1391,Gold Basin Landslide Feasibility and Design,"This project developed a suite of construction alternatives to reduce fine sediment input to the South Fork Stillaguamish from the Gold Basin Landslide.  This glacial deposit has been characterized as the largest single source of sediment input to the South Fork Stillaguamish for several decades (Williams et al 1975) and impacts downstream habitat to the confluence with salt water. More recent work has indicated that it is still a significant source of fine sediment, much of which is deposited in the primary Chinook spawning reaches (Purser 2009, in prep.). The biggest hurdle to treating the landslide and its interaction with the South Fork is the location of a very popular campground immediately adjacent to the river. Any efforts to move the river in a southerly direction away from the landslide and the depositional material at the base of the slide has a potential impact to the campground facility. Working with the USFS, the Tribe developed a suite of alternatives for treating the landslide and its alluvial deposits, picked a preferred alternative, and developed a conceptual design for future construction. All design alternatives addressed impacts to the campground and will be thoroughly analyzed during the NEPA process.

09-1392,Canyon Creek Road Treatments,"Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians used funding to partner with the US Forest Service to continue an erosion and sediment reduction project to improve water quality along Canyon Creek and the South Fork of the Stillaguamish River. The project area includes 14 miles of anadromous fish habitat and 12 miles of resident fish habitat. Canyon Creek is listed as an impaired water body for elevated temperature, which is exacerbated by excess sediment.    In 2011, project funding was used to decommission 6.7 miles of Forest Service Road (FSR) 4120, and to treat and repair 4.9 miles of the FSR 41 mainline, in part to provide access to additional restoration sites. In 2013, erosion control focused on treating 9 additional miles of the FSR 41 mainline road system and decommissioning 3.2 miles of FSR 4130. Road treatments returned unneeded roads to a more natural state and included 1) Blocking decommissioned road entrance; 2) Removing fills and culverts; 3) Creating waterbars and channels to establish drainageways and removing unstable road shoulders; 4) Recontouring and restoring natural slopes; 5) Allowing for natural revegetation from adjacent forest.  The remainder of the roads in the 41 system were addressed by USFS Forest Legacy funds. Since the mid-1980’s, erosion and road failures contributed excess sediment from the tributaries of Canyon Creek negatively affecting the water quality of Canyon Creek and the South Fork Stillaguamish River downstream of RM 33. A 1992 road deficiency survey prioritized this erosion control project, which was further elevated for action following 1995 storm activity. The road prioritization is based on risk ratings and inventoried drainage deficiencies.

The scope of the restoration project included final design, permitting, and the removal of 7,350 feet of existing dike and construction and/or augmentation of 5,000 feet of new dike to protect neighboring farmland.   The project fully restored riverine and tidal processes to 150 acres of diked former tidal marsh. By doing so, we enhanced the flow of water, wood and sediment to areas outside the project area whose functions had been impaired. This project was an integral component of a larger programmatic effort to restore ecological functions to the Stillaguamish estuary, which has been modified by historical large-scale physical alterations that have reduced the capacity of the system to support estuary-dependent species.     This project was a Tier 1 nearshore/estuary priority in the Stillaguamish Watershed's three-year workplan. It had a high projected benefit to salmon and a high certainty of success. By restoring full tidal prism to 150 acres, this project increased the quantity and quality of estuarine habitats for utilization by juvenile salmon, shorebirds, and other estuarine-dependent species.

The purpose was to enhance habitat for salmonids, primarily juveniles, including Chinook. Riparian restoration was one of the critical activities proposed in the SRFB-funded Tychman Slough Assessment and Design Project (08-1578) completed in June 2010.  Himalayan blackberry was the dominant groundcover along the right bank and upper left bank of the project area. SSS crews removed and treated this Blackberry and installed 2315 native shrubs and conifers. Several patches of knotweed were identified on both the left and the right banks, these were treated as well. Weed control and native planting will restore the native plant community on the right bank of the slough providing a more natural nutrient input, increasing shading, and restoring overbank flood flow processes.

10-1338,Lower Skykomish River Restoration Project,"This restoration project improved instream and floodplain habitat along 2 miles of the Skykomish River near Sultan, WA. Overall, the Lower Skykomish River Restoration is a 2.8 mile phased, multi-site, multi-benefit project. With this project, a combination of strategies were applied that work with natural channel processes to promote habitat and water quality improvement, and to help safeguard the productivity of adjoining floodplain areas.   Floodplain flood fencing was installed along 6000 lineal feet of river bank adjacent to active agriculture fields. The flood fencing was inter-planted with conifer trees. Two in-channel flood fence arrays and six small modular log jam structures were completed in Groeneveld Slough. Twenty-five (25) large habitat boulder-ballasted logs with rootwads were placed on the bed of an off-channel slough (Bahnmiller site). Six flood fence arrays were installed on the meander bar upstream on the Labish property. A jam structure was placed, consisting of 11 large logs with rootwads, downstream of the instream bar flood fencing. Thirty-six (36) habitat boulder-ballasted rootwad logs were installed along 370 foot of pool habitat overlapped in an open structure formation. Adjacent to the enhanced pool, the simplified bank edge (370 feet) was rehabilitated by reducing the vertical eroding slope to 3:1, adding edge complexity wood structures, bio-engineered fabric and plantings.  This project resulted from a reach scale geomorphic analysis (attachment #99027) of the lower Skykomish River below Sultan (RM 0 to RM 13.5) Snohomish County conducted to identify and design specific restoration projects that will be consistent with natural processes.This project included high priority actions identified in the adopted 2005 Snohomish Basin Chinook Recovery Plan, 2010 Lower Skykomish River Restoration Assessment, and the County-facilitated Sustainable Lands Strategy Skykomish River Reach Scale Plan. This project was also identified as a Tier 1, primary focus reach project in the Puget Sound Partnership 3-Year Work Plan.

10-1862,Snohomish Sustainable Lands Strategy,"The Sustainable Lands Strategy was launched to reconcile conflict between farmers and fish/wildlife/watershed advocates in Snohomish County over river corridors and estuaries by developing a framework for “net gain” in both agricultural and ecological productivity.   In spring 2010, County Executive Aaron Reardon and County Councilmember Dave Somers co-sponsored and launched, with State agencies and the Tulalip and Stillaguamish Tribes, the Sustainable Lands Strategy initiative for the purpose of reconciling agricultural and restoration imperatives. The primary charge of the SLS initiative is to carefully evaluate problems and opportunities for both “fish and farms” and to design a framework for reconciling differences and meeting the resource needs of both interests.  The initial steps of the initiative were to form a project work group, develop a work plan, and convene stakeholders to assist in accomplishing the SLS mission: To generate net gains in agricultural, tribal cultural, and ecological productivity and health in Snohomish County by developing, within six months, a broadly supported framework of tools, strategies, and policies, including Comprehensive Plan amendments, that will drive harmonized sustainable land-use and resource management decisions. [Adopted July 16, 2010]  After extensive stakeholder consultation and preparation, the SLS process was convened in June 2010 by the State of Washington Puget Sound Partnership, Conservation Commission, Department of Fish and Wildlife; the Snohomish County Executive Office and County Council; and the tribal governments of the Tulalip Tribes and the Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians.   The SLS conveners directed that the initiative be governed by an eight-member Executive Committee consisting of four agricultural and four habitat restoration leaders (including two tribal government representatives) and that it operate on a consensus decision-making basis: all members must agree on recommendations advanced to the conveners.   A Support Team composed of county, tribal, agricultural, and watershed “staff” and experts was assembled on an ad hoc basis to help develop the SLS Framework.  Independent consultants Dan Evans and Lew Moore (the project “Managers”) were selected to facilitate the initial six-month “SLS Framework” phase of the initiative. The SLS Executive Committee held its first meeting on June 21, 2010.  There followed a fast-paced process of stakeholder group and individual interviews, staff consultations, and Executive Committee meetings culminating in the completion of this SLS initial Framework after several months of additional discussion and refinement to achieve consensus.

11-1271,McElhoe Pearson Levee Setback Design,"King County completed final designs to breach the McElhoe Pearson levee to provide salmonid access to floodplain habitat behind the levee. The design included the placement of setback protection along 310th Ave NE. This backwater project restored approximately 1648 lineal feet of off channel edge habitat and 1.57 acres off-channel habitat of the Snoqualmie River (PRISM Attachment 23: Table 2).  The McElhoe Pearson Levee is located near the City of Carnation, along the right bank of the Snoqualmie R at river mile 22. Since levee construction in 1960, the mainstem channel has been confined and disconnected from its floodplain, preventing significant fluvial changes and subsequent habitat forming processes. The area behind the levee contains several depressional areas and is comprised of an early to mid seral stage mixed deciduous/coniferous forest.   The goal of this project is to provide connectivity between the river and the floodplain area behind the McElhoe Pearson levee and provide rearing and flood refuge habitat for juvenile Chinook and other salmonids. This project targets restoring habitat for ESA-listed Chinook salmon and will also improve habitat for other salmonids found in the Snoqualmie including coho, chum, and pink salmon and steelhead and cutthroat trout.

11-1377,Tree Farm Hole Acquisition,"The Stillaguamish Tribe acquired the Tree Farm Hole property, located on the North Fork Stillaguamish River (~RM 20.5) outside of Arlington in Snohomish County. The total project protected 136 acres of floodplain forest, 5,000+ feet of North Fork Stillaguamish shoreline, and over 3,000 feet of side channel from timber harvest and rural development. Riparian restoration included weed treatment and native planting where the building foundations were removed. In addition to contributing to the acquisition cost, matching funds were also used for installation of fencing and a gate to secure the site.    Identified as a priority area for riparian and floodplain restoration/protection in the 2005 Chinook Recovery Plan, this property provides some of the best instream and riparian habitat on the North Fork with high quality spawning and rearing areas for Chinook salmon, as well as Pink, Coho, Chum, Bull trout, and Steelhead. Protecting these parcels while eliminating illegal fishing access (currently a problem) makes significant progress towards the 10-year acquisition goals in the Stillaguamish Chinook Plan.  The Stillaguamish Tribe is providing seasonal public access for legal fishing and wildlife viewing.   The Stillaguamish Tribe used 2010, 2011 and 2012 Federal PCSRF funding awarded by the NWIFC to match the Federal PCSRF and State PSAR funding awarded by the SRFB in 2011 and 2012. The Stillaguamish Tribe prorated the habitat metrics to align to the respective funding shares provided by NWIFC and SRFB so as not to double count project accomplishments. However, because PRISM requires match, the cost metrics in PRISM include the NWIFC funding, as noted in the final report.

11-1381,North Fork ELJ Placement,"The Stillaguamish Tribe installed four Engineered Log Jams (ELJ’s) between river mile 18 and river mile 30 of the North Fork Stillaguamish River west of Darrington, Washington during 2012-2013 field seasons. A reach level GIS assessment of the North Fork from Arlington to Darrington helped inform the project. Suitable ELJ locations were selected so as to optimize spawning and pool habitat for Chinook salmon using a combination of Lidar, aerial photography, FLEER analysis, redd and pool data, and willing landownership/access. Jams were constructed to improve multiple habitat conditions that are limiting Chinook production; they have increased pool habitat and channel complexity, and are intended to reduce temperature, and protect riparian forests. This project continues to work towards achieving the goals outlined in the Stillaguamish Chinook Recovery Plan, which is to place 51 ELJ’s during the first 10 years of its implementation (approximating 30% of properly functioning condition). Since 1999, the Tribe along with several watershed partners have placed 19 complex jams and one 1500' log cribwall in the North Fork Stillaguamish River. Complex wood structures have also been added to Pilchuck Creek, Higgins Creek, and Deer Creek. This project includes $100,000 in PCSRF funding provided by NWIFC to the Tribe and metrics are prorated accordingly.

The project constructed 4 smaller-size large wood structures; improved forest cover along four acres of riparian habitat through native planting and weed control; constructed 2,200 ft of livestock exclusion fencing; and removed 150 feet of bank armoring. The goal of the project was to enhance refuge, spawning, and rearing habitat conditions for salmonids including SF Stillaguamish Chinook which are considered to be at the threshold of extinction (Shared Strategy 2007). Jim Creek is one of two tributaries that provide spawning and rearing habitat refuges for SF Chinook. The project reach is dominated by glide habitat lacking riffles and pools.

11-1650,Port Susan Bay Estuary Restoration - ESRP,"The final construction for The Nature Conservancy's Port Susan Bay Preserve levee set-back project was completed in 2012, and is categorized as an Estuarine/Nearshore Project with a dike removal.  The site is located at the mouth of the Stillaguamish River, on the north side of Hatt Slough, which is currently the main distributary channel for the river.  The Stillaguamish Delta is the cornerstone of the Port Susan Bay Ecosystem, and is a contiguous tidal floodplain with the Skagit Delta. The Nature Conservancy's restoration project initiated restoration of the delta, realizing 50% of the 2005 Chinook Recovery Plan's restoration goals for the estuary. The long-term vision for the conservation program was to restore a functional estuarine ecosystem that is resilient to ongoing threats and adaptable to climate change. The primary objectives of this restoration project included: 1) restore self-sustaining native tidal wetlands that support estuarine-dependent species; 2) improve juvenile salmon access to restored rearing habitats; and 3) improve connectivity between the river and northern tidal habitats to promote estuarine function.   Six main actions were associated with this project:  1. Construction included the removal of 7,350 feet of existing sea dike, brought down to the level of the marsh plain.   2. Additionally, two breaches across the levee footprint were excavated to improve connectivity between marsh channels inside and outside the levee.  This process re-connected 150 acres of former tidal marsh, which had previously been under agricultural cultivation before field abandonment due to drainage issues. The ""starter"" channels encourage marsh tidal inundation, drainage, and juvenile salmon access to interior marsh habitat.  3.  In order to protect agricultural land adjacent to the site, a new 5,000 foot dike was constructed landward of the restoration site.  4. Community trust and advocacy for the project was developed through a transparent community-involved process in which local landowners were included in the Technical Advisory Committee, and involved throughout the design and construction process.  As a result of this process, a $500,000 flood drainage structure was included in construction, which is anticipated to improve flood drainage for Florence Island when upstream dikes are over-topped. Since implementation, there has not been a major flood; the floodgates have thus not been tested yet.  5. 4,200 feet of borrow ditch along the interior of the existing dike was filled in order to better restore hydrology to pre-dike conditions.  6. Post-monitoring  work to identify project effectiveness at the site and estuary-scale.   Post-monitoring:  Post-monitoring efforts were supported for a period of 5 years with ESRP funding.  The monitoring plan was developed in partnership with USGS, and focuses on the main drivers of the restoration- recovering estuarine ecosystem processes and improving juvenile Chinook habitat.  Within each objective, are specific hypotheses and specific predictive or conceptual models.  The monitoring plan was developed using a BACI (before-after-control-impact) design, allowing comparison of baseline ecological conditions with those following the restoration, as well as including control (reference) sites and impact (restoration site) comparison to separate restoration effects from regional changes. The restoration monitoring is nested at two scales; the restoration site and the entire estuary system.  This approach was chosen because the restoration site is located at the river mouth and will therefore affect system-scale processes.  Monitoring elements include landscape, elevation, habitat, hydrology, sediment, and fauna, which together reflect changes in ecosystem structure, function, and processes.    Monitoring results indicate that the estuarine marsh system at Port Susan Bay is not resilient, and is continuing to degrade.  The system is likely susceptible to three interacting factors: inadequate freshwater distribution across the delta's face due to levees and dikes upstream, wave erosion, and snow geese soil disruption via foraging activity.

12-1153,Tolt River Conservation,"King County used this grant to purchase high quality habitat between river mile four and five on the Tolt River, a tributary to the Snoqualmie River. We purchased two developed parcels capturing 1.04 acres along the Tolt River in the San Souci neighborhood. We subsequenty demolished these structures with other funding.  The Tolt River basin is one of the highest priority protection and restoration basins within the Snohomish Watershed. Twenty percent of the Snoqualmie component of the Snohomish Chinook stock spawns in the Tolt River, mainly in the lower six miles. The Snohomish River Basin Salmon Conservation Plan lists protection of the floodplain, riparian area, off-channel habitat and the river’s ability to migrate as top priority actions for recovery. The primary habitats protected by this project are floodplain, off-channel and riparian.  Our long-term goal is to acquire and restore all the properties in the San Souci Reach within the next ten years. Once all properties are acquired, King County will remove an informal upstream levee, the access road and associated utilities. This will provide the river with full access to its floodplain, restoring its ability to form habitat in response to flood events. The primary species supported by this project are ESA-listed Chinook salmon and steelhead trout as well as other salmonids including coho, chum, and pink salmon and cutthroat trout. This project is part of an overall strategy to protect and restore the lower six miles of the Tolt River.",12/6/2012,9/4/2014,Acquisition,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,King County DNR & Parks," $ 338,760.00 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=12-1153,Snohomish Basin LE
12-1241,Nearshore Beach Nourishment Design and Permitting,"Snohomish County used this grant to complete final designs for: I)  Howarth Park Beach Restoration; and II) Restoration of three Beaches at a) Powder Mill Gulch Creek; b) Narbeck, Merrill and Ring Creeks; and c) Glennwood Creek. These Puget Sound nearshore beach nourishment projects are all located along the railroad impounded shoreline in WRIA7 between between Mukilteo and Everett in Snohomish County.   A stakeholder process identified these sites as part of the Nearshore Sediment Nourishment Feasibility Study (Preliminary Design Report, Attach #8; funded by #09-1268) which included conceptual designs for sites 5 and 9. Howarth Park and Site 2 designs were advanced to 30% (Attach 33 & 34). Project deliverables for this 2012 grant included Preliminary Designs for Sites 5, 6, 9, and 10 in accordance with Manual 18 Appendix D-2; and final designs for all locations in accordance with Appendix D-3. Permit applications were submitted but the acquisition of permits will be completed during the construction phase (13-1106).  Restoring more natural sediment delivery and transport processes to and along the beaches and restoring riparian conditions should significantly improve salmon productivity and juvenile capacity (SRBSCP 2005) and is a ""most pressing need"" (highest priority and sequence) in the Snohomish Basin 3-year work plan.

12-1251,Lower Skykomish River Restoration Remlinger,"Snohomish County developed the conceptual designs into a formalized engineered design for a reach scale habitat enhancement project at Remlinger farm, near the City of Monroe. The project is located on the Skykomish River upstream of the confluence with the Snoqualmie and Snohomish Rivers (between RM 0 to ~0.5), in a split channel/island reach consisting of mainstem and off channel habitat. The overall project goal is to enhance and protect a diverse habitat reach by 1) establishing a long-term riparian buffer in an area without riparian vegetation, 2) adding large wood to create and enhance complex edge habitat, and 3) placing instream flood fencing to augment natural river processes. Once constructed, the project is expected to enhance rearing and refugia habitat for overwintering and out-migrating ESA listed salmonids (primarily juvenile Chinook), and provide returning adult holding refugia.  Included in this package is the draft design, construction quantities and cost estimate, stakeholder engagement memo, and other design development correspondence.  This package includes plans for instream flood fencing, edge habitat and large wood placement, and riparian edge flood fencing. Project team conducted outreach to engage the recreational community, the landowner, and potential future project partners.  The Lower Skykomish Geomorphic Assessment indicated that the project reach is a good location for instream structures maintaining island channel splits and side channel habitat.  Finallizing the design for this project however, has been postponed due to the flood events recorded in the Fall of 2015. RCO reduced the funding for the project since the Final Design was not completed.

12-1406,Stillaguamish Knotweed Control & Riparian Rest II,"The Snohomish Co. Noxious Weed Control Board (SCNWCB) & Snohomish Co. Public Works Surface Water Management (SWM) had worked with community members to restore riparian habitat along the South Fork & North Fork Stillaguamish River. This project had continued a landscape-scale, coordinated program of protection & restoration of riparian ecosystem function through control of invasive knotweeds. To restore and protect salmon habitat, Snohomish County Noxious Weed Control Board & Surface Water Management proactively worked with private and public landowners to control knotweed on the North Fork; then Surface Water Management's Native Plant Program installed native plants in knotweed treated areas. The entire South Fork was surveyed and determined to almost be 100% free of knotweed.   With an average of 7% of the historic population returning each year, Stillaguamish River Chinook are highly threatened of becoming extinct. Currently riparian habitat is degraded. Lack of tree cover & the spread of knotweed contributes to high water temperatures, excessive sedimentation, reduced food supply, & loss of in-stream cover, all of which harm salmon. Knotweed, a non-native plant, is invading the project area; creating dense monoculture stands that crowd out native vegetation. Knotweed regenerates from severed roots and stems, spreads easily downstream.   This project improved salmon habitat by increasing shade, leaf & wood input, improving bank stability, & decrease knotweed presence. Project partners include Snohomish Conservation District, Sound Salmon Solutions & Snohomish County Surface Water Management.

12-1421,WRIA 05 Priority Area Water Typing,"Wild Fish Conservancy water typed over 30 miles of stream channel in selected sub-basins and floodplain areas of the Stillaguamish to verify and update Washington Department of Natural Resources, Snohomish County, and United States Forest Service stream classifications and hydrolayers. Additionally, a subsample of fish species composition and relative abundance were sampled at selected low gradient tributary sites using single pass eletrofishing, single pass pole seins, fyke nets, and minnow traps to determine Chinook presence or absence. To select study areas and sub-basins for watertyping, WFC conversed via e-mail and in person with representatives from the WRIA 05 Technical Committee, Stillaguamish Watershed Council, Snohomish County and the United States Forest Service. Match funding was required to be utilized on US Forest Service lands. Consequently, the focus area on USFS lands (which included some stream reaches which were greater than 4% gradient) were identified by the USFS, reviewed by the Stillaguamish Technical Advisory Group and approved by the Stillaguamish Watershed Council. The primary goals of this project included: 1) produce accurately mapped and classified hydrolayers within the Stillaguamish so that headwater streams and floodplain habitats represented on these maps can receive the protection and planning warranted under existing regulations 2) protect streams which support salmonids and listed species by providing data which can be used to make informed decisions 3) document the use of nonnatal tributaries by Chinook in the Stillaguamish 4) develop a foundation for a better dialog and understanding between the agricultural community and fish biologists 5) identify at least five significant restoration/protection opportunities and produce conceptual designs for at least one of the opportunities approved by the TAG.

The analysis began upstream of the SF and Mainstem confluence at RM 0, near Arlington, up to RM 30, near Darrington. The purpose of the project was to prioritize and sequence actions along the reach to maximize efficient and effective use of available resources in support of suitable habitat for ESA-listed Chinook salmon, steelhead and bull trout. This ensures that projects are integrated and that restoration funds will be spent where they will have the greatest effect.  Project tasks included data collection and analysis on channel morphology, bank conditions, floodplain topography, hydrology, hydraulics, riparian conditions and habitat for salmonid in this reach. The project identified and assessed the feasibility of specific actions to address specific problems identified in the Recovery Plan including: reducing fine sediment inputs, LWD placement, floodplain connection, and riparian rehabilitation and protection (PRISM #245907).

12-1490,Pilchuck Creek Woody Debris Design,"Snohomish County completed final designs for large wood installation at three sites along the lower Pilchuck Creek (river mile 0.8 to 6.2) near the mouth of the Stillaguamish River, in order to increase stream depths during summer low flow and thereby improve adult Chinook salmon passage to high quality spawning habitat. This project builds off feasibility analysis and conceptual designs completed as a part of project 08-1617, which found low water depths at Pilchuck Creek impede the upstream migration of ESA-listed (""fall"") Chinook salmon. Differences in stream cross-section morphology strongly affect the water depths experienced at a particular low flow rate. 2011 habitat inventory data shows a low level of large woody debris necessary to provide diverse cross-sectional water depths and sediment sorting.  This phase completed the final design deliverables listed in Manual 18 (2012) Appendixes D-2 and D-3. Permits were submitted and will be acquired during a future construction phase.  WDFW has conditoned the Hydraulic Permit Approval for a public outreach process, Snohomish County is considering how to approach this process to have positive outcomes that engage stakeholders to a greater degree than past efforts. This project is listed in the 3 year workplan. It is responsive to a data gap found in the Stillaguamish Watershed Chinook Recovery Plan (low flow impedance of adult Chinook salmon migration). Pilchuck Creek is the lowermost tributary to the Stillaguamish River that is habitat for Chinook salmon and there is more than 9 miles of potential spawning and rearing habitat downstream of a natural barrier streamwide barrier called Pilchuck Creek Falls.",12/6/2012,3/5/2015,Planning,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,Snohomish County Public Works," $ 175,876.70 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=12-1490,Stillaguamish River LE

The worksite falls within the estuary priority restoration area listed in the 2005 Stillaguamish Chinook Recovery Plan and is strategically located across from Leque Island. This grant partially funded the final design and permitting necessary to restore 83 acres of estuary habitat, and provide needed rearing habitat for juvenile Chinook salmon. Data from the Stillaguamish estuary suggests that the current state of habitat is limiting smolt production (Griffith 2009), perhaps explaining why significant reductions in harvest have not translated to long term increases in adult returns. This project will also reduce flood elevations on Florence Island and around the city of Stanwood by providing increased storage and improved conveyance in the old mainstem. When complete, this project would nearly double the estuary acres restored to date, bringing the total to 183 of the 315-acre estuary restoration target of Stillaguamish Chinook recovery plan.

13-1106,SnoCo Beach Nourishment Const,"Snohomish County used funds to initiate restoration of a 4.5 mile drift cell adjacent to the railroad impounded shoreline between Mukilteo and Everett in Snohomish County by a) placing 16,879 cubic yards of sediment at five locations (three sites) adjacent to stream deltas and b) completed restoration at the City of Everett’s Howarth Park, removing 0.4 acres of existing bank protection and associated fill from the beach and placing 9,888 cubic yards of sediment, and planting 0.5 acres of near-shore appropriate plant species. The total project restored 2.4 acres of near-shore habitat. Goals included improving the quality of nearshore habitat along 4.5 miles of shoreline by augmenting the supply of finer sediments to the upper intertidal zone to benefit Chinook salmon, bull trout, steelhead, Pacific Sand Lance, and Surf Smelt.  An additional goal was to ease public access to the shoreline at one of only two saltwater parks in the city.  This project implemented the beach nourishment restoration designed and permitted with funding from 12-1241.

These actions have begun to restore natural river processes along this reach and reconnect the river with 50 acres of forested floodplain.  Over 300 large trees were removed from the levee during construction and placed in the adjacent floodplain where they would contribute to habitat complexity along the right bank as the channel migrates into these logs and the mature, forested right bank floodplain.  The set-back revetment included four log structures intended to protect the road and private property from the river as it migrates across the floodplain, while also providing good fish habitat. The log structures are backed by a new 850-foot long rock revetment at the lower end of the site to provide additional protection where the river is most likely to migrate. Sixteen acres of invasive knotweed were also treated across the floodplain, and the site was planted with about 11,000 native trees and shrubs. Soil excavated from the project area was provided to nearby farmers to build farm pads that help protect farm animals and equipment during flooding while reducing the project's disposal costs. King County will continue to assess the project’s impacts on both flooding and salmon habitat. The ten-year monitoring plan includes mapping habitat features, documenting channel changes, tracking fish use, and monitoring water levels and vegetation.   The narrative above described all work completed at the project site, including work funded by sources other than this grant and match.  The SRFB grant and associated match funded the removal of 0.30 miles of levee/revetment, enhancement of 1.1 acres of off-channel habitat, placement of 0.35 miles of log structures placed over 0.20 acres of the riverbed and removal of invasive plants along 0.5 miles of streambank - including about 10.7 acres of treatment and plantings.

13-1166,Lower Wallace River Conservation Area,"Forterra, in partnership with the Tulalip Tribes, permanently protercted 121.7 acres along the Lower Wallace River near Goldbar to provide high-quality spawning and rearing habitat for wild stocks of Chinook, coho, chum, and pink salmon and bull trout. The long-term objective of the project is to protect more than 107 acres of riparian floodplain habitat (which includes 30 acres of wetlands) along approximately 1.3 miles of Lower Wallace River and 0.35 miles (both sides) of Bear Creek. Protection of the property will also allow for future restoration. In July 2013, Tulalip Tribes formally consented to hold and manage the Lower Wallace River property in perpetuity and in October 2015 they took title to the property.  The Tribes have identified the site as prime salmon rearing habitat and intends to steward the property for riparian habitat preservation.

13-1169,Tolt River Conservation 2013,"King County used this grant to purchase high quality floodplain, off-channel and riparian habitat between river mile two and five on the Tolt River, a tributary to the Snoqualmie River. King County purchased three parcels in fee totaling 5.35 acres along 1,150 feet of the Tolt River and an active side channel. The long-term goal is to restore all the properties in the San Souci Reach. With these acquisitions, the County is proceeding with a feasibility study of the San Souci area to  remove an informal upstream levee, the access road and associated utilities.  This will provide the river with full access to its floodplain, restoring its ability to form habitat in response to flood events.  Additionally, one of the parcels purchased is downstream of the San Souci area and captures a portion of the footprint necessary to set back another river facility once additional properties are purchased.   The primary species supported by this project are ESA-listed Chinook salmon and steelhead trout as well as other salmonids including coho, chum, and pink salmon and cutthroat trout. The Tolt River basin is one of the highest priority protection and restoration basins within the Snohomish Watershed. Twenty percent of the Snoqualmie component of the Snohomish Chinook stock spawns in the Tolt River, mainly in the lower six miles. The Snohomish River Basin Salmon Conservation Plan lists protection of the floodplain, riparian area, off-channel habitat and the rivers ability to migrate as top priority actions for recovery.  The target property was larger than the three properties acquired. One of the original target parcels was originally interested in selling and then changed his mind.   After the target property fell through as an option, the county reached out to other owners in the restoraiton area. The county successfully acquired 3 properties, part of a future levee setback project.  This was a reach acquisition project, requiring buy-out of a neighborhood for a future floodplain restoration project. The three homes purchased were more expensive, than one. The County increased their match to afford a better outcome than would otherwise be achieved, as we are required to pay appraised fair market value for conservation properties.",12/5/2013,2/5/2018,Acquisition,Closed Completed,Puget Sound Acq. & Restoration,King County DNR & Parks," $ 770,000.00 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=13-1169,Snohomish Basin LE

The project site is located on 106th Ave NE near Arlington. The barrier at site JO31 is a total blockage located on unnamed tributary 5.0346; the crossing consists of two stacked round corrugated steel pipes. The barrier at site JO30 is a single 18 inch round steel pipe located on a spur road immediately upstream of JO31 on right bank tributary 5.0347 and is also a 100% blockage. Snohomish Conservation District will replace the stacked culverts at JO31 with a 40 foot steel or concrete bridge and replace the undersized 18 inch pipe with a 12 foot wide single arch on footings. Correction of these two passage barriers will provide access to 2.82 miles of spawning and rearing habitat for coho and searun cutthroat trout up to the first total barrier in this system and 4.62 miles of potential fish habitat gain with correction of upstream barriers.  ,9/1/2013,12/29/2015,Restoration,Closed Completed,FFFPP Grants,Snohomish Conservation Dist," $ 268,571.41 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=13-1471,Stillaguamish River LE
13-1555,Leque Alternatives Analysis and Design,"Duck's Unlimited (DU) used this grant to support WA Dept of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW)'s decision making process regarding the future management of southern Leque Island. As a result of this project, WDFW decided to restore 250 acres of tidal marsh, nearly all the available land on the island. DU supported WDFW's decision making process by completing final engineering design, overseeing technical studies, and permitting related to Phase 1 and by completing 60% design for Phase 2.   WDFW's decision-making process carefully and critically examined several alternative solutions to failing dikes at Leque Island and the implications for department mandates, site operations, fish and wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities. WDFW solicited public input at open houses and in meetings with stakeholders. WDFW recruited volunteers to participate in a Stakeholder Advisory Committee. With input from the public, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee, and DU, WDFW developed Design Selection Criteria to evaluate different design scenarios.   DU developed conceptual design alternatives and cost estimates.  Concurrently, subconsultants completed hydraulic modeling and ground-water monitoring to evaluate those alternatives. The studies focused largely on evaluating restoration goals and potential impacts to neighbors, including the combined effects of the project and the nearby 100 acre Zis-a-Ba Restoration Project.  These technical elements proceeded slowly to allow adequate time for WDFW to solicit and incorporate input from stakeholders and the public.  Agency and stakeholder concerns drove the design process, which in turn informed and drove the technical elements.   In May 2015, WDFW management chose the preferred alternative.  After new dike failures in 2016, WDFW decided to phase the project. Phase 1 would build the interior drainage network, Phase 2 would re-introduce the tides. DU completed engineering design, oversaw technical studies, and permit compliance related to Phase 1, which: * Excavated 18,260 linear feet of new tidal channels within the project site.  Excavation impacted 10.8 acres and redistributed  40,000 cubic yards (CY) of material. * Filled  8.4 acres of existing artificial drainage features interior of the perimeter dike, including drainage ditches and borrow areas.  39,200 CY of material excavated from the new tidal channels was used as compacted fill in these areas.   * Removed 1,900 linear foot berm bisecting the project area. Material associated with the existing berm (up to 700 CY)  was spread in 4-inch lifts across about 1.5 acres of the project site  * Created low-elevation habitat / wave attenuation hummocks. The hummocks are 1 to 3 feet tall and designed with a top elevation low enough to maintain wetland hydrology before the perimeter levee is breached.   Phase 1 was necessary to hedge against more unintended dike breaches. After completing Phase 1, if an accidental breach occurs, WDFW and DU will evaluate the benefits and costs of repairing the breach based on its extent and location. With Phase 1 completed, there is a greater chance that repair of a breach will not be necessary because the tidal channel network is already configured.  Phase 2 will occur when final design is complete and enough money is on hand to re-introduce the tide.    As part of this grant, DU and WDFW continued to advance Phase 2 design and prepared for permitting resulting in additional studies and design documentation.",7/1/2013,9/21/2018,Planning,Closed Completed,Estuary & Salmon Restoration,Ducks Unlimited - Vancouver," $ 753,604.00 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=13-1555,Stillaguamish River LE
13-1574,South Pass Estuary Restoration Feasibility,"This project conducted a restoration feasibility study (detailing a preferred conceptual design), developed a monitoring and adaptive management (M&AM) plan, and collected very basic baseline monitoring data and fish and vegetative communities at zis a ba (restoration site located along South Pass). We partnered with the Skagit River System Cooperative (SRSC), and convened an advisory group of potentially affected local stakeholders (Flood control district, Twin City Foods, City of Stanwood) to guide the implementation of the project. The feasibility study addressed four primary areas: fish benefit, tidal channel/distributary evolution, vegetation/habitat evolution, and effects on surrounding infrastructure (dikes, drainage, underground pipes, etc.). Based on the results of the study, a preferred conceptual alternative was chosen and the effects on the areas listed above described in detail. As part of the study, a M&AM plan was developed for the site, and baseline fish and veg. data collected.  Match for the grant was in the form of hydrodynamic modeling of the preferred alternative undertaken by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) on behalf of Ducks Unlimited (DU).",7/1/2013,9/5/2017,Planning,Closed Completed,Estuary & Salmon Restoration,Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians," $ 107,271.00 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=13-1574,Stillaguamish River LE
14-1040,Steamboat Slough (Mid-Spencer) Enhancement Design,"Snohomish County has completed most final design deliverables leading up to contract bid documents and initiated permitting to create new, and enlarge existing breaches on Mid-Spencer Island located in the Snohomish River estuary, east of Everett, Washington. The property is owned and managed by Snohomish County for conservation purposes. Historically, the site was diked and farmed, but abandoned in the late 1960s. Since this time the dikes along Steamboat Slough and Union Slough have naturally breached at several locations. These breaches are fewer in number and generally narrower in width than would naturally occur, resulting in significantly limited tidal and riverine inundation compared to intact reference sites (e.g. Otter Island). The project goal is to enhance access to and quality of Snohomish River estuary tidal marsh habitat for juvenile salmonids. Design and permitting deliverables completed are in preparation for restoration construction, with objectives being to: Increase size, quantity, frequency and diversity of breaches; Increase biological, hydrologic and geomorphic connectivity between sloughs, intact tidal marsh areas and tidal marsh restoration sites; Restore natural processes, including tidal channel formation, large wood recruitment, sediment delivery, and native re-vegetation; and Increase tidal channel density within the project site.

14-1054,Woods Creek Restoration Assessment,"Adopt A Stream Foundation completed Woods Creek In-Stream Restoration Assessment in Snohomish County WA, north of the City of Monroe in the Woods Creek Watershed (WRIA 7). The overall project goal was to develop preliminary designs for large wood (LW) placement projects in Woods Creek for future funding.  The project included: a watershed wide cultural resource screening, landowner acknowledgements and and an agreement, preliminary engineering, a cost estimate, and efforts to seek additional funding. This project was part of a partnership between the Snohomish Conservation District and Adopt A Stream Foundation to implement the Woods Creek Riparian Enhancement Action Plan (HWS #07-RPR-034). Adopt A Stream Foundation developed eleven (11) LW placement project designs in high priority reaches of the Woods Creek Basin.  Conceptual designs were drafted for these projects.  Preliminary designs were drafted for the seven (7) highest ranking (with benefit to salmon) projects that were included in SRFB grant application #15-1131 Woods Creek In-Stream Restoration Partnership.  To develop these LW projects the Adopt A Stream Foundation (1) Coordinated with Snohomish Conservation District on their previous work in this watershed; (2) Completed a parcel-specific analysis that prioritizes lands in the Woods Creek Basin that have the potential and the opportunity for LW installations; (3) Contacted landowners to assess their willingness to complete restoration work; and (4) Prioritized and developed LW projects.  Targeted Priority Species for this project were Chinook, Coho, Steelhead, Bull Trout, Pink, and Chum.

14-1226,Cherry Creek Restoration-Ph I,"Sound Salmon Solutions completed Cherry Creek Phase 1 at the confluence with the Snoqualmie River just north of Duvall, improving riparian habitat in an agricultural zone, and increasing in-stream edge habitat surface area and complexity. This project treated 1,000 lin. feet of Cherry Creek (360 ft. island perimeter + 325 ft. Cherry Cr w/ new channel left bank around island + 315 Cherry Cr w/ right bank channel around island = 1000 ft. = 0.19 mi) and included:  • Widening the mouth of Cherry Creek. • Constructing a low broad island (8,238 sq. ft.) at the mouth of Cherry Creek that added 360 ft. of edge habitat in the widened mouth. The recontoured bank has 36 pinned logs with rootwads facing out (filled with riprap and spoils) and bioengineered terraces constructed with soil filled coir wattles. The entire island was capped with excavated topsoil, covered with erosion control fabric and seeded with erosion control grasses. • Constructing the island created a 185 ft. secondary channel off the left bank. • Removing Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus) and a small patch of invasive knotweed (Polygonum sp.) from 0.7 acres along both sides of Cherry Creek (640 linear ft.) by brush cutting, scraping, and then burying the remaining biomass on site, in an excavated pit under 9 ft. of fill. • Removing exposed and buried riprap along a total of 630 ft. (0.12 miles) of stream banks from the mouth of the original channel on both banks up stream and used as ballast for pinned LWD in construction of the island. • Regrading the creek banks to a minimum of a 2:1 slope with 10' planting benches on both banks creating 7,030 sq ft of floodplain area. • Installing 13 LWD clusters, 6 on the left bank and 4 on the right and 3 ""super clusters"" at the broad points of the island. • Planting 60 native trees and 275 native shrubs along 640 ft. of stream bank to a 35' wide buffer as well as on the island for a total of 0.7 acres. (Several hundred more plants including willow and dogwood stakes will be installed in 2020 as part of two King County grants - Cooperative Watershed Management and One Million Trees.)  There were significant cost increases over the course of the project due to spoils disposal expenses; a total of $293,679 in additional funding was requested and approved by Snohomish Watershed Lead Entity and RCO/SRFB to afford excavation in the floodplain.  The project addresses the need for Chinook spawning and rearing habitat in Cherry Creek, as expressed in the Snohomish Basin Salmon Conservation Plan, which lists Cherry Creek as a primary rural restoration stream and this section of the Snoqualmie as a primary mainstem restoration area. The project also benefits other salmonids which use Cherry Creek, including Steelhead, Coho, Chum, and Pink.

14-1306,"North Meander Reconnection, Ph III Design","Snohomish Co. completed preliminary designs to reconnect approximately 0.5 miles of abandoned channel meander and restore about 8.5 acres of off-channel and mainstem refuge habitat in the lower Stillaguamish River at the North Meander. This project builds upon the success of two previous projects (01-1307 N Meander Slough Reconnection and 05-1605 N Meander Reconnection Phase II) and a proposed wood placement project (14-1289) which focus on the eastern portion of the remnant bend. Phase III investigated and planned restoration of the western portion of the N Meander enhancing connectivity with the Stillaguamish River and/or Cook Slough, in order to restore natural habitat forming processes for the purpose of creating off-channel rearing habitat for juvenile salmonids and foraging habitat for adult bull trout.  In addition to reconnection alternatives, different wood placement structures were evaluated to enhance habitat value, and hydraulic and sediment transport to the system as a whole. Four alternative scenarios were modeled, analyzed, and the preferred alternative selected. Preliminary design of the preferred alternative depict structures design and channel layout supported by stability calculations.

14-1356,Stillaguamish Floodplain Protection & Restoration,"The Stillaguamish Tribe protected and restored floodplain processes in the NF, SF, and Mainstem Stillaguamish River through acquisition and restoration of river front properties, following the priorities outlined in the 2015 Stillaguamish Watershed Acquisition Strategy for Chinook Salmon Recovery. This project addressed Large Wood, Riparian, and Floodplain limiting factors as described in the 2005 Chinook Recovery Plan, and provided direct benefit to threatened Chinook, Steelhead, and Bull trout populations. This project made incremental progress towards  a corridor of conserved lands along the major salmon bearing waters of the Stillaguamish where natural processes can resume unencumbered by infrastructure/armoring. The 2005 Chinook recovery Plan identifies the need to acquire a total of 7225 acres by 2055.   This project provided funding for the purchase 185.67  acres, spread over seven properties along the Mainstem, North and South Fork Stillaguamish, protecting over 1.94 miles of river  from development or habitat alteration!  The matching funds for these purchases took the form of riparian (Haag and Hebert planting and invasive control) and instream  restoration work (Hebert instream wood placement) at two sites- one on the mainstem (Haag).   Additional PCSRF matching funds were used to purchase a portion of the Eubanks property (9.2 acres, protected 0.15 miles of stream,  reported in PCSRF database).

The goal was achieved in the South Fork where knotweed infestation was light.  Along the North Fork, knotweed was detected upsteam from the Oso Slide.  The goal was adapted to include knotweed control upstream of the slide area or close to the source of dispersal.    A total of 265.4 gross acres were treated between 2016-2019.  The acreage was a combination of new and retreated areas.  13 river miles were protected along the North Fork Stillaguamish and 26.5 river miles were covered in the South Fork Stillaguamish.  22.6 acres along 1.8 river miles were planted between 2016-2019 with 8500 native trees and plugs.  The project exceeded the original goal expectations.  Only the North Fork Stillaguamish was planted.  The South Fork Stillaguamish have light patches of knotweed, and less planting opportunities.  5 large sites were planted.  2600 tree plugs were planted at three locations, downstream from the Oso slide.  25 new landowner permissions were gathered, less than the original intent.

15-1124,Jim Creek Restoration Ph II,"Snohomish County used this funding to construct habitat restoration begun by Sound Salmon Solutiuons (PRISM 13-1095) to increase stream complexity and diversity along a quarter mile of Jim Creek near Arlington, WA and improve spawning and rearing habitat for Chinook salmon. This project constructed one large wood structure to further the restoration designed with funding from 2010 SRFB-funded design grant (PRISM 09-1377).  During the 2015 construction season Snoco was able to obtain and deliver materials for two of the ELJs.  One of the ELJs was constructed in September 2015 before the HPA in-water work window expired.  An extension of the work window was not granted. During the 2016 construction season county forces were allocated to other projects and the second ELJ was not constructed. One of the major lessons learned is that although county forces provide a great service at an exceptional price there are limitations of using this approach.  State law prohibits county forces from doing more than $90,000 of work (including materials) on projects outside the right-of-way.  This resulted in reducing the number of ELJs from three to two.  The availability of county forces is limited and their efforts must first be dedicated to county roads maintenance.  This resulted in not completing the second ELJ. The costs for the project were reduced to $97,363 because the County did not have the capacity to complete the work.

15-1333,Stillaguamish Side-Channel Monitoring,"Side channels (SC), which are important salmon rearing habitat in floodplains, have been modified or lost due to modern land uses. Floodplain restoration, a vital sign for recovery of Puget Sound, is desired for habitat capacity, connectivity, and to support habitat-forming processes to which salmon are adapted. This project is a regional SRFB monitoring project and supports Stillaguamish Monitoring and Adaptive Management, which assesses the status of and progress toward recovery targets for habitat limiting factors.  This project evaluated summer SC habitat quality and quantity in the North Fork, South Fork, and mainstem Stillaguamish rivers. Potential SC fish habitat was mapped and classified using LIDAR and field knowledge. We classified SCs based on formation process/type then surveyed 41 of 111 SCs covering 16.3 out of 42.6 km using NOAA-NWFSC monitoring protocols. We calculated SC metrics (e.g., habitat areas, woody debris) and floodplain metrics (e.g., SC/MS ratio, sinuosity) using NOAAs Puget Sound Floodplain Units. We found 199 pools within the surveyed SCs and their value in terms of salmon habitat was highly dependent on how they were formed. 89 of 188 pools were formed by woody debris, particularly in avulsion-expansion channels that contained higher wood loading, but were smaller shallower and infrequently spaced, so comprised only 20% of all pool area. In contrast, 23 deep, beaver-formed pools accounted for 49% of summer pool area in lateral scour, wall-based and oxbow SCs where juvenile salmon were visually more abundant. Beaver-formed habitat was affiliated with channel cut-off processes co-located with tributary inflow, notably in the North Fork. In many cases SC pool habitats were colder than adjacent mainstems indicating their resiliency to warming. Project strategies for the active floodplain include enhancement of existing SCs, channel forcing, stabilizing proto-SCs, beaver analog devices, and managing SC avulsion in areas of high hazard.

16-1318,Leque Island Estuary Restoration Construction,"Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) and partner Ducks Unlimited (DU) constructed the Leque Island Estuary Restoration Project that restored estuarine processes to the 250-acre interior of Leque Island by removing 2.4 miles of dikes. Leque Island is located near Stanwood in the nearshore environment, immediately west of the confluence of the old Stillaguamish River channel (West/South Pass) in Port Susan Bay. The project involved removing all levees to reintroduce tidal processes to the entirety of the island, which will restored tidal channels and salt marsh to benefit juvenile salmon that rear in the Stillaguamish River delta. In addition to dike removal, the project included excavation of 3.9 miles of new tidal channels in the restored area, filling of man-made drainage ditches, and excavation of tidal headwater areas.  WDFW and DU included a 0.7 mile long wave protection berm in the design to protect a vulnerable section of shoreline in the City of Stanwood.  This berm is now a walking trail used by the community.  This construction project implemented the preferred option modeled in the Leque Island Alternatives Analysis and Design Project (SRFB 04-1651, ESRP 13-1555, NOAA).

16-1356,zis a ba Estuary Restoration,"The Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians reconnected tidal and riverine influence to approximately 87 acres of former Port Susan Bay estuary lands that had been disconnected by dikes, restoring estuary rearing habitat for juvenile salmonids, especially Endangered Species Act listed Stillaguamish River Chinook populations. Located near Stanwood, the project built  a setback levee and flood control structure to protect adjacent property owners, graded  the site  to encourage natural tidal channel development, but also protected infrastructure that traverses the property.  The project was completed in two phases.  Phase I (2017) excavated over three miles of tidal channels, installed 131 pieces of wood in 89 structures, removed a tide gate, constructed a habitat berm to protect Twin City Foods pipelines, built a 750' setback levee, and removed over a mile of old levee.  All together more than 43,000 yards of material were moved in Phase I and the site was returned to tidal influence in October of 2017- the first time in over 100 years that tides had flooded the site. Phase II (2018)  completed a Flood Control Structure in the new setback levee, and removed a culvert on a portion of the site that was missed in Phase I.    The project was completed with a combination of ESRP, National Coastal Wetlands, and SRFB funding.  The final  few months of the project were spent monitoring the recently restored area  to collect data called for in the Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan.  We will be seeking another year of monitoring funding outside the project performance period and will write up the results in 2021 or 2022.

Project-related work occurred primarily in First and Second Riparian Priority sub-basins that support Chinook salmon as described in the Stillaguamish Watershed Chinook Salmon Recovery Plan. Riparian restoration benefits Chinook salmon, as well as coho, chum, pink, steelhead, rainbow, and cutthroat. The Riparian Crew consisted of offenders from Monroe Corrections Complex who are supervised by a Corrections Officer and managed by Tribal staff. Over the course of this project, crew members contributed labor to achieve project objectives and received training related to native plants, invasive weeds, and habitat restoration. This ongoing partnership provides a valuable resource in the long-term restoration and stewardship of riparian forests in the Stillaguamish Basin.",1/19/2018,5/25/2023,Restoration,Closed Completed,Puget Sound Acq. & Restoration,Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians," $ 715,668.00 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=16-1539,Stillaguamish River LE
16-1559,Mid-Spencer Estuary Restoration,"Snohomish County enhanced natural tidal exchange processes on Mid-Spencer Island by improving connectivity along approximately 0.75 mile of Steamboat Slough (eastern shoreline) and 0.75 mile of Union Slough (western shoreline). Mid-Spencer Island is centrally located east of Everett, WA in the Snohomish River estuary where the tidal slough channel network links the few naturally intact islands to large newly restored areas. This project created immediate improvements to site access and habitat for fish by enhancing connectivity for the neighboring Smith Island restoration site (located across Union Slough) and creating conditions that allow for natural restoration of tidal influences and floodplain connection over the long-term. Project elements included:  - breaching 16 sections of remnant dike to connect naturally developing interior channels to the main slough;  - removing 43 historic pilings from the new tidal channel openings.   - removing ~35 spruce trees (planted 17 years ago) from the remnant dike and re-purposing for channel edge complexity and interior fill to create a complex organic base for a diverse aquatic and terrestrial insect community;  - excavating approximately 1,095 feet of interior channels;   - adding 15 vertical wood arrays in the interior of the island to encourage natural racking, aggrade the marsh, and provide nurse material for native vegetation to accelerate the rate of native vegetation diversity and succession to forested scrub shrub wetlands;  - creating 8 bird perches using spruces removed from the remnant dike and drift logs with rootwads.  The interior of Mid-Spencer Island is now accessible to young salmon, providing critical rearing habitat and food sources. Without these areas of refuge, the river currents are too fast and channels too barren for juvenile fish to feed and hide. The newly created habitat and increased tidal channel accessibility will increase the estuary's carrying capacity for juvenile salmon. The new connections decreased the previous fish travel distances to the interior tidal wetland channel habitat by a total of 9352’ (1.77 miles). Increasing the juvenile salmon out migration survival rate and improving early conditioning will help increase the number of returning adult salmon. The estuary rearing is particularly important for Chinook salmon whose well being is linked to the survival of the Southern Resident Killer Whales, as well as Snohomish County citizens' cultural, recreational, and economic interests.

16-1608,Woods Creek Culvert Replacements Cooperative,"Snohomish Conservation District partnered with Snohomish County and Wild Fish Conservancy to restore unimpeded fish passage to approximately 3.1 miles of valuable spawning and rearing habitat for ESA-listed Chinook salmon, steelhead trout, and bull trout, and other salmonids by replacing 5 prioritized fish passage barriers in the Woods Creek sub-basin complex. The County replaced a county-owned culvert on the East Fork of Woods Creek. Snohomish Conservation District (SCD) replaced two livestock bridges with passable bridge structures on Richardson Creek, and Wild Fish Conservancy (WFC) replaced two culverts and realigned one pedestrian bridge on private property (note: the pedestrian bridge was not an is not a barrier to fish passage) on Richardson Creek; all new structures meet WDFW fish passage guidelines. These actions improved sub-basin hydrologic and sediment processes, cited by the 2005 Snohomish River Basin Salmon Conservation Plan as a first-tier priority action because hydrologic and sediment processes create and sustain high quality habitat over the long term. Wild Fish Conservancy and Snohomish Conservation District leveraged the County culvert construction funding as match to advance these fish passage improvements in the Woods Creek basin. This subbasin-scale, coordinated and cooperative approach has achieved habitat gains faster and more efficiently by leveraging public resources to implement recovery actions on private lands as well as in the public right of way.  This project funded design, permitting, and construction of the five fish passage barrier replacements (grant funding was not used for the County-led barrier replacement, but County costs were used as match and contributed to the total project cost). Work types included cultural resources compliance, restoration/construction (fish passage improvement of bridges/culverts), engineer designs (conceptual through final), and permitting (preparing permit applications and permit fees). The project restored fish access to 2.3 miles of Richardson Creek (a tributary to Lower Woods Creek) and 0.8 miles of unnamed tributary 7.0841, a tributary to East Fork Woods Creek. These fish passage improvement project sites are located in the Woods Creek sub-basin; Richardson Creek is located in the Lower Woods Creek sub-basin which is identified as Mainstem - Secondary Restoration strategy group in the WRIA 7 Snohomish Watershed Salmon Conservation Plan (2005); the unnamed tributary 7.0841 is located in the \Woods Creek sub-basin which is identified as a Rural Streams - Secondary Restoration strategy group. For both these sub-basin strategy groups, fish passage improvement is identified as either second-tier or third-tier priority restoration actions (where no second-tier priorities were identified).   Funds from PCSRF FY14 were spent within the award window since, although this project was completed outside of that award with FY17 funds.

16-1639,Woods Creek RR Bridge Removal & Restoration,"The Adopt A Stream Foundation produced preliminary design deliverables and secured initial  support to remove an abandon railroad bridge that spans Reach 1 of lower mainstem Woods Creek immediately upstream of Al Borlin Park in Monroe. Designs specify the a) preferred approach for removing to 150 foot long, 30-feet high railroad bridge with more than 45 creosote-treated log pilings, b) riparian habitat restoration activities, and c) addition of mid-channel and bank-based large wood structures to maintain instream complexity.  Reach 1 of Lower Woods Creek provides crucial off-channel rearing habitat for juvenile Chinook and other salmonids from both Woods Creek and the Skykomish river. It is documented that Chinook salmon use reach 1 for spawning as well as rearing. According to the Woods Creek Habitat Conditions Report (2013), fish production in this reach is limited by low LWD volumes and frequency, unstable banks, high sediment loading and shallow pools. Wood regularly racks up on the bridges, creates debris jams, and sometimes these jams become very large, often ten feet or more in vertical height. Large debris jams impede fish passage and interfere with sediment transport.

16-1719,Beckler Confluence LWD Design,"Over the course of this project WFC engineers and ecologists developed restoration treatment designs for the project site that include using Engineered Log Jams (ELJs) to capture and retain sediment in the mainstem of the Beckler river channel, which when implemented, will improve aquatic habitat diversity and reconnect the channel to its historic floodplain. The project site is located in the Mt. Baker Snoqualmie National Forest, near the confluence with the Skykomish River, just north of the town of Skykomish. The designs developed in this project are an important step towards the development of a restoration treatment for the alluvial fan of the Beckler River. The future restoration project will improve instream habitat conditions for all native fish species, including ESA listed Chinook salmon, Steelhead and Bull Trout, which all use this reach. The project will also improve connectivity between the river and its floodplain, likely resulting in the development of off channel habitat, which serves as important rearing habitat for coho salmon as well as flood refugia habitat for all juvenile salmonids.",12/8/2016,1/31/2019,Planning,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,Wild Fish Conservancy," $ 117,086.00 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=16-1719,Snohomish Basin LE

16-2758,Collins - Harris Cr - R15,"Wild Fish Conservancy assisted the private landowners in replacing a fish-passage barrier on their private forest land road which crosses Harris Cr, a tributary to the Snoqualmie River in King County. The previous structure was an undersized 4.0ft. diameter x 20ft. long round corrugated steel culvert. Following a level B fish-passage assessment, the culvert was determined to be a partial barrier with 67% passability. The barrier culvert was removed and replaced with a box culvert which allows unimpeded fish passage at this crossing, and addresses flooding impacts to the private driveway. This restoration project improved salmonid access to 5.43 miles of upstream spawning and rearing habitat for coho, steelhead, and cutthroat trout which are documented in the watershed and potentially improved migration access for bull trout which are presumed to be present.

17-1107,Grant Creek Construction Designs,"The lower reach of Grant Creek, a Chinook bearing tributary of  the North Fork Stillaguamish, was surveyed to assess current in-stream habitat conditions relative to salmonids focusing on large woody debris, pool and riffle locations and distribution, and stream bank conditions. Geomorphological surveys were completed to assess in stream sediment inputs,  budget,s and distribution and current channel morphology. Hydrological modeling was performed to analyze stream channel response to preliminary designs. The landowner, Nick Bright, was coordinated with extensively for property access, anecdotal information about high water marks and presence of salmon in the creek. Sound Salmon Solutions supported the project through facilitating coordination between A&E consultant Wild Fish Conservancy and property owner, providing input and review of 30% & 60% design drafts and preliminary design report, and administrative project management.   30% design draft was created utilizing survey results. After review the project extent was redefined and alternatives created for a one or two phase design. 30% design was finalized and 60% design draft created using further analysis of wood and sediment inputs from the upper watershed and results of hydrological modeling. 60% designs were reviewed and finalized along with preliminary design results.   The preliminary designs address the following in stream habitat deficiencies found during site surveys and analyses:  *Lack of persistent large woody debris of size and complexity to sort sediments and create and support persistent pools *Insufficient pool formation to sustain rearing *Disconnected off stream channels *Diminished in stream channel complexity *Poor floodplain connectivity *Sparse aging deciduous dominated tree canopy deficient in conifers  Constraints defined during the survey process were:  *Adjacent land use by property owner for pasture and agroforestry *Two vehicular bridges - one county owned, one private *Portions of the right stream bank in the upper reaches where the bank has been armored are not owned by project landowner *Outlet of Grant Creek to NF Stillaguamish also not owned by project landowner  Major design recommendations from the 60% designs are:  *Encourage general streambed aggradation throughout the reach *Encourage local variations in bed slope *Encourage side scour and widening of the channel *Create new channel bedforms by blocking the existing thalweg and forcing an increase in sinuosity *Increase the pool frequency and depth of existing pools in the reach *Slow the transport of gravel out of the reach and cause an overall decrease in the average size of bed material *Increase the frequency of overbank flows *Create high flow and low summer temperature refugia for fish  The 60% design addressed these recommendations by focusing on a passive approach to improving in stream geomorphology and floodplain connectivity through strategic placement of LWD. Vertical logs installed in the stream bed, channel spanning keyed in logs, and bank anchored log clusters will be installed at specific locations to encourage changes in thalweg direction to ""let the stream do the work"" of sediment sorting, pool and riffle formation, side channel reconnection, and overbank flows.

Planning work also included analysis of potential downstream effects following dam removal (Dam Removal Analysis for Sediment), cultural resources review and associated permitting, and involved a robust community outreach effort with multiple community meetings and digital media to engage and inform stakeholders.  The City of Snohomish operated a municipal diversion dam facility at river mile 26.4 of the Pilchuck River since 1912, impeding upstream fish migration for more than 100 years. Removing human-made instream barriers is a priority in both the Middle and Upper Pilchuck sub-basin strategy groups as identified in the Snohomish Basin Salmon Conservation Plan. Completion of this planning project allowed the dam removal project to be shovel ready and restoration was completed in the summer of 2020 (funded in part with SRFB #18-167).",1/19/2018,2/18/2021,Planning,Closed Completed,Salmon Federal Projects,Tulalip Tribes," $ 199,298.89 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=17-1153,Snohomish Basin LE
17-1238,Woods Creek Culvert Cooperative Design (Phase II),"Snohomish Conservation District developed landowner support and completed preliminary designs to replace a partial fish passage barrier on Sister of Friar Creek in the Woods Creek sub-basin. This project was the next phase of the Cooperative's work to correct priority fish passage barriers in the Woods Creek sub-basin. This barrier was identified as a Tier 2 priority in a Barrier Assessment and Prioritization completed by Snohomish Conservation District, Wild Fish Conservancy, and Snohomish County as part of the Woods Creek Culvert Cooperative partnership. This barrier was the next highest priority barrier with a willing landowner, after correction of those funded as part of another Salmon Recovery grant (16-1608). There is one Tier 1 priority barrier that is prioritized for correction, but not yet implemented as the landowner is not willing to participate.   The goal of this project was to complete preliminary engineering, a design report, cost estimate and initiate permit consultation for a future fish passage project. When this barrier is corrected, it will improve fish access to 1.26 miles of stream habitat for coho and cost cutthroat trout in a Rural Streams priority sub-basin as identified in the Snohomish River Basin Salmon Conservation Plan (2005).   Grant funding was used to complete landowner engagement and preliminary design activities including survey and data gathering, development of correction alternatives, correspondence and site visits with landowners to discuss correction alternatives, initial consultations with WDFW and correction alternatives, selection of preferred alternative, and development of preliminary design documents aligned with SRFB Manual 18 Appendix D-2.   The project received only partial funding, so the scope was reduced from final to preliminary design for one crossing.

The project occurred on private property in the Warm Beach Community, where this small coastal stream flows into Port Susan Bay. Restoration work involved daylighting the creek by removing two fish barrier culverts, constructing a more natural channel, filling the ditch, adding instream wood, and improving riparian habitat by treating weeds and planting conifers and other native species.   A Tulalip Tribes study documented juvenile Chinook densities were especially high in small streams adjacent to the Stillaguamish River delta. As a result, this specific restoration action was identified as high priority for Snohomish County, and the restoration of Warm Beach pocket estuaries is high priority in the Stillaguamish Watershed Chinook Salmon Recovery Plan and the Regional Nearshore and Marine Aspects of Salmon Recovery in Puget Sound. The project goal was to create and enhance rearing habitat for juvenile salmonid species including ESA listed Puget Sound Chinook, cutthroat, coho, and chum.

18-1443,Stillaguamish Floodplain Acq. & Rest.,"This project provided partial funding for two high priority acquisitions in the Stillaguamish - Trafton Floodplain and Thurmond Farm (AKA zis a ba II, 248.33 acres).  It also provided complete funding for the Bruce Bryson property. The remaining acres of Trafton Floodplain and zis a ba II was paid for with matching funds. This came from a variety of other sources: NEP thru Snohomish Conservation District, Floodplains by Design, Coastal Wetlands, ECY Streamflow restoration, and NTA 2018-0218. Once the grant got underway we had fully funded the Segelsen property  already and moved attention to zis a ba II and Bruce Bryson, which were the next priority opportunities aligned with the Stillaguamish  Acquistion  Strategy.  All three sites will have extensive restoration actions implemented in the coming years.  The Trafton Floodplain site has more than 4700' of levees and armoring that will be removed, making way for the installation of hundreds of pieces of wood, the excavation of side channels, and more than a hundred acres of riparian restoration (currently in design).  Zis a ba II (Thurmond, in design currently) will be a major  tidal wetland project at the mouth of Hatt's Slough, allowing for new distributary channels into mid-Port Susan, which will better connect  out migrating smolts to the Leque Island, TNC PSB, and zis a ba I tidal wetland projects (all RCO funded). The Bruce Bryson property will  allow for the installation of a series of ELJs on lower Boulder River and the confluence with the North Fork, once further adjacent lands are acquired (Peek, DNR, etc., in progress). In the meantime, riparian planting work will be undertaken, along with removing infrastructure.  All  properties purchased with this funding are priorities for acquisition and restoration under the Stillaguamish Chinook Recovery Plan (SIRC 2005) and its associated Acquisition strategy (SWC 2020).  These acquisitions work towards the goals of thousands of aces of floodplain, estuary, and riparian restoration, engineered log jam installation, and miles of bank armoring/levee removal. This project benefits Chinook, Chum, Coho, Pink, Steelhead, and Bull Trout.   Stillaguamish Tribe used funding to acquire floodplain and former estuary habitat prioritized for protection and restoration in Stillaguamish Chinook Recovery Plan (SIRC 2005) and its associated Acquisition strategy (SWC 2020).  This grant contributed:  1) 100% to the Trafton Floodplain acquisition costs. A floodplain reconnection and restoration project is slated for construction in 2025.  2) 37% to the Thurmond Farm (zis a ba II) acquisition costs which is former estuary habitat slated for restoration in 2024. Thurmond Farm was also supported by PSAR grant 19-1365 “Stillaguamish Tidal Wetlands Acquisition” and acres are prorated accordingly. 3) 100% of Bryson floodplain property. Current restoration targets riparian habitat, but in the future (once adjacent lands are acquired) engineered log jams will be installed at the confluence of the Boulder River and the NF Stillaguamish. The Segelsen property (a part of the original scope) was removed from the project when it was acquired with other funding.

The 150-acresite is critical estuary habitat for fish species such as  Chinook, Chum, pink, and Coho salmon as well as Bull trout, Cutthroat trout, and Steelhead. SRFB funds were used to evaluate adaptive management options to enhance ecosystem processes and fish habitat at PSB. Scientific tools including an allometric channel analysis (Hood 2019) and 2D hydrodynamic modeling were used to develop three restoration design alternatives (see Preliminary Design Report, Port Susan Bay Restoration Project, 2020). A preferred alternative was selected that provided a cost- effective method to achieve the project’s goals. Local stakeholders including a Technical Advisory Committee provided important suggestions that helped the team refine the restoration design.  A PSAR Capacity grant provided support for additional modeling to ensure that TNC’s restoration design would align with future restoration an adjacent property owned by the Stillaguamish Tribe. A 60% Preliminary Design Report was completed and the permitting process has been initiated.

18-1532,Gold Basin Landslide Restoration ,"The Stillaguamish Tribe constructed a  large restoration project in 2021 at the USFS Gold Basin Campground near Granite Falls. Elements included:  - Removal of campground infrastructure including the lower paved road section, picnic tables and fire rings, two bathrooms and a water line to make room for the restoration project;  - Excavation of a new 2300-foot channel through a portion of the campground to move the South Fork Stillaguamish several hundred feet from the edge of the Gold Basin landslide apron.  This involved 215,000 yards of excavation; - Tipping and re-use of dozens of trees in the footprint of the new channel which were placed instream in the new channel;  - Trucking in more than 1600 pieces of large wood that were added to the new channel to enhance instream habitat and prevent the South Fork from re-occupying the old channel;  - Relocating the South Fork Stillaguamish to the newly created new channel and constructing sediment detention basins in the old channel in addition to large plugs of sediment at the up and downstream ends of the old channel; - Restoring  riparian habitat by planting hundreds of native trees and shrubs in the disturbed areas during the winter of 2021-22.  Project elements were designed to improve the aquatic environment by introducing large woody debris and improving water quality. Together, these components have already dramatically limited the fine sediment delivery to the South Fork, reducing impacts to salmon habitat on site as well as downstream pool filling and shallowing, all the way to salt water at Port Susan Bay. This project was primarily designed to address the needs of Chinook salmon but will improve habitat for coho, pinks, steelhead, and bull trout as well as numerous other aquatic invertebrates while maintaining part of the campground for recreational visitors.

18-1589,Bernhardt - Coon Cr - R16,"Snohomish Conservation District replaced a partial fish passage barrier on a tributary to the Pilchuck River to improve fish passage to 4.21 miles of F type freshwater stream habitat. This tributary, sometimes identified as Coon Creek, provides habitat for coho, chum, Chinook, and pink salmon as well as bull trout and steelhead. The barrier replacement will improve fish passage and access to habitat for these species.  This project is part of an ongoing fish passage barrier partnership by Tulalip Tribes, Snohomish County, Snohomish Conservation District, Sound Salmon Solutions, and other project partners to replace dozens of priority fish passage barriers in the Pilchuck River watershed. The Bernhard - Coon Creek project site was the lowest barrier on the tributary system and is approximately 0.56 miles downstream of a Snohomish County-owned stream crossing where the fish passage barrier was replaced in 2019.   Work activities completed during this project include cultural resources and fish passage work types. Snohomish Conservation District worked with FFFPP to complete a cultural resources consultation; an archaeological survey was completed as part of the cultural resources consultation. SCD completed design, permitting, landowner communications and outreach, public works bid and construction contract management, consturction oversight and inspection, and general grant and project management activities as part of this fish passage barrier replacement project.   SCD hired a contractor, Konnerup Construction, to replace the 5 foot diameter round metal culvert with a 26 feet 3 ¾ inch wide by 8 feet 10 ¾ inch high by 40 feet long bottomless plate arch culvert with headwalls. The contractor also restored the stream bed and banks within and adjacent to the culvert, rebuilt and resurfaced the road within the project area, installed guardrails, and installed temporary and permanent utilities. This project required landowner communication with the private property owner who owned the road crossing and five additional residential property owners who either use the road on which construction occured to access their property or who provided temporary construction access for the residences for the entire duration of construction.   The project required three amendments including a cost increase and two time extensions to complete this project. The project and SCD experienced several challenges that led to time delays and cost increases.

18-1617,Thomas' Eddy Hydraulic Reconnection Prelim-Design,"Snohomish County continued outreach and planning for Thomas' Eddy restoration on the Snohomish River to improve the quality and quantity of channel edge and off-channel habitat and connectivity between the main channel, floodplain and associated floodplain waterbodies. The project is located in the Heirman Wildlife Preserve between river mile 16 and 18 of the Snohomish River. In the 1930s, levee construction in this area isolated more than 200 acres of Snohomish River floodplain including approximately 1.5 miles of off/side channel habitat and added nearly a mile of modified and rip-rapped edge to the river. Planned restoration actions include removal of portions of levee, side channel and edge habitat enhancements, jam construction, and riparian planting. The project funded preliminary design (60% design) and outreach and stakeholder engagement to achieve agreement on a preferred alternative. Floodplains by Design funded 30% design (attached in PRISM). Outreach and planning involved substantial engagement with County Parks Dept. and stakeholders including the Heirman family, fishing community, birders, and other park users.   The completed 60% design proposes to remove a total of 3,685 ft of levee in multiple breaches and return natural floodplain connection to more than 200 acres of floodplain, while fully connecting 1.5 miles of off-channel habitat. The lower 1,600 feet of the channel will be enhanced with 17 small wood structures. Along the outer riverbank of the site, up to 2,000 ft of bank armor will be removed, and 12 bank log jam structures will be added to provide edge complexity. An additional 10 Bar Apex Log Jams are proposed on mainstem locations along the reach. On the floodplain, 45 wood structures were designed to provide roughness and habitat complexity. Other planned work includes replacing a trail culvert to improve hydraulic connection and fish passage, improved trail drainage, and 50 acres of invasive plant removal and native riparian planting. This project is also proposed to have future phases that include additional recreational and agricultural elements to address additional stakeholder desires.",12/6/2018,10/13/2022,Planning,Closed Completed,Salmon State Projects,Snohomish County Public Works," $ 235,295.00 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=18-1617,Snohomish Basin LE
18-1628,Haffner-Barfuse Floodplain Restoration Design,"King County completed preliminary design of the Haffner-Barfuse project, renamed as the Fall City Floodplain Restoration Project, to restore natural riverine and floodplain habitat forming processes along a high priority reach of the Snoqualmie River.  The project location, downstream of the Raging River and town of Fall City, is categorized as a mainstem primary restoration sub-basin in the Snohomish River Basin Salmon Recovery Plan. The preliminary design includes two high priority floodplain restoration projects that will remove or modify a levee and revetment on opposite sides of the Snoqulamie river. This two-in-one project combines two projects identified by the SRFB-funded Snoqualmie at Fall City Reach Assessment.    When constructed this project will increase and improve edge and off-channel habitat and gravel bar formation for juvenile salmonids and reduced scour of redds thereby benefiting adult salmonids. The Haffner and Barfuse projects will remove 2,600 feet of revetment or levee to allow unconstrained natural processes in approximately 145 acres of floodplain and reconnect almost a mile (0.85 miles) of side channel and increase forest cover and vegetative diversity on 110 acres in the floodplain and along waterways. In addition to salmon habitat improvements the project will benefit the local community with the construction of a newly aligned and modern Haffner revetment on the right bank and relocation of Neal Road SE to reduce regular flood damage to the road and property landward of the project area.    Once construction is complete (PRISM 20-1078), restored processes and habitat will contribute to the recovery of ESA-listed Chinook salmon and steelhead trout, as well as benefit other salmonids including coho, chum and pink salmon and cutthroat trout. As part of the preliminary design process King County engaged the community to raise awareness about the project and collect feedback and concerns. Engagement efforts included a virtual public meeting, public website, video tours, postcard mailing, and in-person meetings with nearby landowners and local Tribes. Preliminary Design meet standards in Salmon Grant Manual 18 Appendix D-2 and most of the Cultural Resources Review was completed for the project area  and meets the RCO standards identified in Manual 18 Section 6.

18-1671,Pilchuck Dam Removal Restoration Project,"The Tulalip Tribes used funding to fully remove the Pilchuck River Diversion Dam in order to increase longitudinal connectivity in the river, allowing fish access to pristine and diverse habitat types with cooler water and intact ecological processes. The project goal is to increase the river's capacity to support recovery of ESA listed fish species including Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout along with coho, chum, pink, and cutthroat. Since installation in 1912, the dam blocked upstream migration, effectively reducing capacity for fish and other species to utilize over 37 miles of high quality-priority habitat upstream of the dam. The dam was located at the transition between the moderate to highly modified lower/middle watershed, and the relatively pristine upper watershed. Accessibility/connectivity and associated resiliency will become increasingly important with climate change. Upon dam removal, listed fish species now have uninhibited access to over 37 miles of priority spawning and rearing habitat, and over 1/3 of the mainstem river habitat. The dam was no longer used by the City of Snohomish for water withdrawals, and the current proposal had wide stakeholder support. Match was provided through Federal, local and/or private grant contributions for dam deconstruction contractual costs.

18-2028,Peterson - Haystack Cr - R16,"Snohomish Conservation District corrected a fish passage barrier on Haystack Creek, a tributary to the Skykomish River, by replacing a pair of 5 ft diameter culverts that were depth and velocity barriers to fish with a 60 foot long steel bridge. The crossing is the primary access for the landowner , Mr. Peterson, to access his house and farm. The new structure meets WDFW fish passage guidelines.  This project funded design, permitting, and construction of the fish passage barrier replacement. Correction of this barrier was part of a larger project on Mr. Peterson's property that included correction of 2 other fish passage barriers.  The other barrier corrections were funded by grants from Snohomish County, the Washington State Conservation Commission, and the Natural Resource Conservation Service.  Work types included cultural resources compliance, restoration/construction (fish passage improvement of bridges/culverts), engineer designs (conceptual through final), and permitting (preparing permit applications and permit fees). The project restored fish access to 2.46 miles of habitat for chum, coho, steelhead, and searun cutthroat to Haystack Creek.  No cost or scope amendments were needed for this project.

Leque Island is located near Stanwood in the nearshore environment, immediately west of the confluence of the old Stillaguamish River channel (West/South Pass) in Port Susan Bay. The project involved removing all levees to reintroduce tidal processes to the entirety of the island, which restored tidal channels and salt marsh to benefit juvenile salmon that rear in the Stillaguamish River delta. In addition to dike removal, the project included excavation of 3.9 miles of new tidal channels in the restored area, filling of man-made drainage ditches, and excavation of tidal headwater areas. WDFW and DU also constructed a 0.7 mile long wave protection berm to protect a vulnerable section of shoreline in the City of Stanwood. This berm is now a walking trail used by the community. This construction project implemented the preferred option modeled in the Leque Island Alternatives Analysis and Design Project (SRFB 04-1651, ESRP 13-1555, NOAA).",1/22/2018,8/11/2020,Restoration,Closed Completed,Estuary & Salmon Restoration,Fish & Wildlife Dept of," $ 1,626,377.32 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=18-2319,Stillaguamish River LE

Once constructed, the project will meet the County’s goals of enhancing rearing habitat for juvenile salmon and improving refuge for migrating adult salmon in the North Fork Stillaguamish River. The future restoration project aims to accomplish these goals by a) constructing woody debris features and structures to add geomorphic and hydraulic complexity and diversity to the side channel, potentially including structures to address avulsion potential, and b) removing fill within the floodplain and enhancing the native riparian buffer and floodplain along the river and side channel. The wood structures were designed to create pool habitat, cover, and complex edge habitat. It is anticipated that restoration of the riparian buffer will entail restoration of a native floodplain forest of mixed coniferous and deciduous species. Design of engineered log jams (ELJs) for this project were based on several factors including channel geometry, project goals, and site hydraulics.

19-1365,Stillaguamish Tidal Wetlands- Acq. ,"The Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians used this grant to partially purchase 248 acres of former tidal wetlands at the mouth of the Stillaguamish River, known locally as the ""Thurmond"" farm. The Tribe immediately changed the name to ""zis a ba II"" since it is their vision to connect this site to zis a ba I via three phases over the next several years. This land was diked and drained in the late 1800s for farming and is only about 7 feet above sea level. Purchasing the land was the first step in supporting the Tribe's efforts to move the levees back, flooding the land once again for habitat for Chinook salmon. The river is used by Chinook salmon, which is a species listed as threatened with extinction under the federal Endangered Species Act. Since purchase, the Tribe has been coordinating with neighbors and other interested groups on the plans for restoring the site.   SRFB funding in this grant acquired 156 acres total or 63%. 37% of the Thurmond Farm (zis a ba II) acquisition costs were supported by PSAR grant 18-1443 Stillaguamish Floodplain Acq & Restoration and acres are prorated accordingly.

19-1366,Grant Creek Construction,"Grant Creek Construction was completed through final designs and permitting and ready to go to construction summer 2020. The bulk of the LWM had been purchased and delivered on site. Due to COVID related issues securing a construction contractor was delayed and the summer 2020 fish window was passed. In order to complete installation of the LWM and to save on funding both a time extension and a sponsor change were requested and granted. Wild Fish Conservancy, the A&E contractor for this project became the project sponsor.   Prior to handing off project sponsorship SSS working with WFC was able to ensure cultural resources was completed, all survey, permitting, and  design work were done and cleared access routs for construction. SSS took the lead in working with the landowner and navigated past issues with neighboring properties. JTI Construction was awarded the bid in winter 2021, and construction was completed during summer 2021.    The purpose of the design shown in these plans is to restore, to the extent possible, the natural processes that will create and maintain complex fish habitat in Grant Creek. During this project WFC placed 115 pieces of large wood within a 0.3 mile reach of Grant Creek between Grant Creek Road and Hillis Rd.  The 17 large wood complexes will encourage the development of new scour pools and to improve overall channel complexity. Wood placements will also help to sort sediment, encourage aggradation and localized deposition of spawning-sized gravel, and improve floodplain connectivity.

While the original scope of the project was to replace the barrier culvert with a pedestrian bridge, the cost of a bridge would have been extremely expensive.  Not only would King County Parks require the bridge to support emergency vehicle access on the SVT, but the soils on site were found to be too mucky and not suitable for a bridge. Designs for the pre-cast concrete box culvert were guided by the 2013 WDFW Water Crossing Design Guidelines.  The existing undersized culvert presents a velocity barrier with a passability of 33%. The replacement structure will provide 100% passability and fully comply with WDFW guidelines. When this fish passage barrier is corrected, an additional 1.37 miles of rearing and spawning habitat will be available to chum, coho, sea-run cutthroat trout, as well as ESA listed threatened Puget Sound steelhead, and Puget Sound Chinook. The long-term goals of the project are to 1) restore access to essential rearing and spawning habitat for salmonids; 2) improve habitat and floodplain conditions; and 3) improve drainage in order to increase farmable acreage in the Snoqualmie Valley.

The Tribe determined that adaptive management is not needed at Zis a ba at this time.   The site has re-vegetated at an incredible rate and is being used by ESA listed salmon populations.    Leque (250 ac.) and Zis a ba (83 ac.) are large tidal wetland restoration projects previously funded under RCO projects 16-1318 and 18-2319 (Leque), and 16-1356 (Zis a ba). Both projects were designed to work towards the estuary restoration targets outlined in the Stillaguamish and Skagit Chinook recovery plans by setting back levees and excavating tidal channels across the sites. The projects were designed to  primarily benefit juvenile salmonids on their way to sea, especially ESA listed Chinook populations. Monitoring data indicates the projects also  benefited other juvenile salmonids (like chum) and forage fish like herring, smelt, and sand lance.   In the course of this project, the Stillaguamish Tribe finalized/updated monitoring plans for Leque and zis a ba, and collected/reported on data for some of the ecological attributes identified in the monitoring plans at both sites.

Fish production in this reach is limited by low amounts of instream wood, unstable banks, high sediment loading and shallow pools.  The creosote preserved timber railroad trestle degrades water quality, disrupts stream processes, and sometimes creates a fish passage barrier when large amounts of debris accumulates on the upstream face of the bridge.  Lower Woods Creek is within the Skykomish River floodplain and provides crucial off-channel rearing habitat for juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead, both are species listed as threatened with extinction under the federal Endangered Species Act; for coho salmon, which is a federal species of concern; and for chum and pink salmon.  SRFB funded the earlier phase of preliminary design (16-1639).

20-1306,Sultan River Floodplain Activation Design,"Snohomish PUD contracted for the assessment, modeling, study and design of additional habitat restoration work on the lower Sultan River. The additional restoration was voluntary effort (not a license obligation or mitigation requirement) to investigate furthering the restoration of the lower Sultan River floodplain to assist in creating high quality salmon habitat. This work was to include on-channel and off-channel work. On-channel work analysis included addition of engineered log jam, excavation of channels on an island, and removal of a small inlet plug (KB Island) that was tampering water from entering the side channel network. Off-channel elements included the restoration/creation of an additional side channel to provide more rearing opportunities for salmonids. The work under this grant included the hydrologic modeling to design increased amount of off-channel rearing habitat that was in the historic floodplain of the lower Sultan River. A wetland delineation occurred to identify wetlands in the proposed project alignment to inform design and permitting needs. In addition, a cultural resources survey was also conducted to verify that  there were no historic properties or cultural resources in the area of the proposed project. No cultural resources or historic properties were identified. Initial consultation and applications with permitting agencies occurred, again to further the design based on input from agencies.    After high flow events and further analysis of the proposed project elements, it was determined that some of the items originally proposed under the design grant are no longer needed to move forward to the construction phase. This includes the excavation of additional channels on the island - high flow event in 2020 provided additional wood and gravel on the island; thereby doing naturally what was anticipated to occur through active construction. Additionally, Snohomish PUD used the designs created under this contract and funded the construction work. Based on the designed placement of a engineered log jam along the upper extent of the grant project, the project would have created less desirable results in Side Channel 2 (the area opposite of the log jam) and hindered the continued extensive use by spawning chum salmon. As such, those three elements are currently not being sought for construction funding under the new grant cycle.   The restoration/creation of an additional off-channel habitat of 1,900 lineal feet was designed.

97-1295,Stillaguamish Slough Protection,"The Stillaguamish River supports a regionally important fishery that is at risk.  Of the 5 species of salmon in the watershed, 2 (chinook and coho) are listed by state and tribal agencies as ""depressed.""  Nonpoint pollution has closed commercial shellfish beds at the river's outlet.  Pollution problems prompted the Department of Ecology to fund an early action watershed plan.  The 1990 plan (which included habitat actions) continues to be actively implemented under the guidance of the citizen/agency Stillaguamish Implementation Review Committee (SIRC).  This application arises from a 2-year effort by the SIRC and its member organizations to identify priority habitat protection and restoration sites.  Studies helped set priorities.  The Tulalip Tribe's coho habitat loss study (1997) found that a lack of rearing habitat severely restricts coho production.  A related study by the Corps of Engineers (1997) identified 3 sloughs on the mainstem as priority rearing habitat restoration sites.  This application proposes purchase of conservation easements on the 3 sloughs.  This will protect 105 acres of riparian habitat as a key step in slough restoration.  Eventually, 4600 lineal feet of valuable off-channel rearing habitat will be restored using other funds.  Through easements and future restoration projects, coho production could increase by an estimated 50,000 smolts/year while providing quality habitat for waterfowl, migratory birds, and other wildlife.",4/13/1998,5/6/2003,Acquisition,Closed Completed,WWRP - Riparian Habitat,Snohomish County of," $ 157,986.48 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=97-1295,Stillaguamish River LE

The catalyst was a massive landslide in the Deer Creek Watershed.  This effort includes state, federal, local and local agencies, Indian tribes, conservation groups, educational institutions, small and large private landowners and interested citizens.  The present manifestation of this cooperative effort is in a reach scale habitat restoration effort located between River Mile 20 - 23 which is presently funded by State JFE funds and USEPA funds. The cooperators have surveyed, designed and engineered plans necessary to gain appropriate permits for the introduction of large woody debris mimicking stable log jams which provide critical habitat for anadromous and resident salmonid species.  Combining our existing funded effort with conservation easements and additional restoration dollars will provide a tremendous restoration opportunity.  This will be monitored over time to present data adequate to draw conclusions on its success.  Approximately 200 acres of land is targeted for acquisition via conservation easement.  The location of the project was chosen due to its high use for spawning Chinook salmon and their need for cover and holding habitats. Additionally, the same engineered log jam technology will be utilized to reduce sediment inputs from large landslides and unstable stream banks which are presently impacting salmon habitat.",4/13/1998,5/6/2003,Acquisition & Development,Closed Completed,WWRP - Riparian Habitat,Wild Fish Conservancy," $ 283,784.47 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=97-1299,Stillaguamish River LE

Five ELJ's were built at river mile (RM) 21 of NFS.  Preliminary assessments indicate significant Summer Chinook holding habitat has been created & the ELJs have performed as expected.  This project will implement Phase II of the North Fork Stillaguamish (NFS) Engineered Logjam (ELJ) Project.  WT will construct 3 ELJs at approx RM 22.5, and perform post construction monitoring.  The sub-reach where ELJs will be installed is a plane-bed channel with ample spawning area, but limited Chinook use.  ELJs will provide vital holding habitat that will allow Chinook access to spawning areas.  Holding habitat will increase at least 2 - 3 fold in this reach and direct the habitat away from an area of negative human impacts.  Juvenile rearing will be enhanced & access to valuable off-channel habitat restored by project implementation.  Long-term goals in phase II include the securing of conservation easements on adjoining properties.  All necessary permits are in hand.

99-1369,Lower Griffin Creek Restoration Project,"The objective of the project is to improve salmon habitat & water quality in lower Griffin Creek.  Activities include livestock exclusion fencing; placement of woody debris; riparian vegetation planting; channel reconfiguration to restore natural stream meander; increasing frequency & size of pools; adding off-channel habitat for rearing & flood refuge; and adding a set-back berm 100 ft from the channel to prevent sheet flow from flooding pastures & stranding juvenile fish. Griffin Creek is one of the most productive salmon streams in the entire Puget Sound area - five species of Pacific salmon utilize the lower mile for spawning. Coho spawn & rear throughout the entire system.  According to WDFW escapement surveys from 1984-1993, 20% of Coho in the Snohomish Basin come from Griffin Creek. Griffin Creek is thus the largest contributor to the Coho population in the entire Snohomish basin. Protection of this resource is critical to the continued survival of Coho salmon in King County. Presently, salmon habitat in the first river mile is in poor condition. The riparian buffer is too narrow & fails to provide adequate canopy cover. The channel has been straightened over time & side channels eliminated. Few pieces of large woody debris are present in the stream.  The stream has breached its banks in some places. Landowners are willing participants in this project, and much work has already been done at the site, including restoration of 350 ft of streambank.",7/29/1999,5/16/2001,Restoration,Closed Completed,Salmon State Projects,King County DNR & Parks," $ 112,431.48 ",https://secure.rco.wa.gov/prism/search/projectsnapshot.aspx?ProjectNumber=99-1369,Snohomish Basin LE

In addition, key existing drainage ditches will be reconstructed/reconfigured to more closely reflect natural meander patterns through the flood plain and to increase fish access to the area.    The revegetation portion of the project will enhance the existing upland forest complexity with understory plantings of conifers for diversity, habitat, and potential LWD recruitment to the flood plain, and will restore native plant communities consistent with topographic elevation, soil type, and expected hydrologic regime post dike removal.  The planting area will cover approximately 20 acres along the toe of Fobes Hill and along the portion of the existing dike that will remain after breaching.  The work will consist of reduction of invasive exotic species and the establishment of native plants.     The channel reconfiguration portion of the project will hydraulically connect the proposed tidal restoration area to Ebey Slough at low tides and improve fish access to inner portions of the tidal restoration area.  This will be accomplished through the relocation of key existing channels and the addition of meanders to other channels as outlined in the Drainage District 6 Restoration Plan.

Patterson Creek ranks 4th in productivity of Coho for sub-basins in the Snohomish Watershed.  Field studies in 1991 confirmed that coho, cutthroat, chinook, and rainbow trout use the creek.  Over time, agricultural use has altered habitat in the basin, resulting in a ditched stream, uniform channel characteristics, devegetation, & an influx of invasive species including reed canarygrass. The project will: increase riparian vegetation & stream channel shading; add off-channel pond habitat for rearing & flood refuge; place large woody debris in ponds for cover; remove reed canary grass & other invasive/exotic plants; & construct small hummocks in the floodplain for conifer establishment. Hummocks will be wrapped in coir fabric to prevent erosion during high water events.  A variety of other native plant species (including alder, cottonwood, aspen & willow) will also be planted in the project area to help shade out reed canarygrass.  Reed canary grass will be removed manually over the first few years, as the trees establish.

99-1401,Riley Slough Restoration Project,"Riley Slough is an important link in the Sykomish River watershed and harbors excellent side channel habitat for salmonids because it nas not been straightened.  Historically, the slough provided important spawning and rearing habitat for year-round runs of coho, and populations of steelhead trout.  Currently chinook, chum and coho salmon use the slough as overwintering and rearing habitat, but the populations have declined due to extensive growth of reed canary grass and blackberries.  Restoring Riley slough will enhance the habitat within the slough as well as nearby off channel areas such as Haskel Slough.    The Snohomish Conservation District & the Stilly-Snohomish Fisheries Enhancement Task Force proposes to restore aquatic and riparian habitat diversity by removing the non-native vegetation and re-planting with native shrubs and trees.  Planting will commence in the spring of 2000, and will include conifers which will not only provide shade along the stream bank, but will serve as a future source of large woody debris. To protect water quality, agricultural areas will be fenced along the stream to exclude livestock in adjoining pastures.  This will protect water quality, enhance the survival of streamside vegetation, and decrease erosion.    A baseline habitat assessment will be completed prior to start of the work.
